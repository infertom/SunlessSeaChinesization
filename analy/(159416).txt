Id:159416
Description:Narrow waterways and quaggy paths. Marsh-lights and mud. Now and then, parasynthetic mosses like shaggy curtains. Now and then, a questing tentacle. [Each event will take you further into the swamp. Go deep enough, and you'll find something interesting.]

Id:134251

		RareDefaultEvent
Name:Byways

		DefaultEvent
Name:Struggling on
Id:159506

		DefaultEvent
Name:A respite
Id:159508
Description:You mount a guard on the walls - build a fire of stinking peat - upend your boots to evict sulky tadpoles. The swamps around you resound with sobbing whoops and screeching creaks - but nothing shows itself. Time passes.

Name:Gossip!
Id:165473
Description:Your own voice echoes back from the low branches of a thorn-cypress. You're speaking poetry: a limping line about the still waters of the swamp.

		DefaultEvent
Name:Solacefruit
Id:159512
Description:"...was the flint a tool, or merely a rock? It was impossible to be certain. The solacefruit, too, which grew on the tree - they are parasitic, and they will grow wherever they choose, but their colours mimicked the bark. Perhaps this was their native tree. Impossible to be certain..."

		DefaultEvent
Name:Rapture
Id:159513
Description:"...rapture! Whatever had happened to this poor soul, whoever they had been, they had welcomed their end. Solacefruit hung in parasitic clusters from its woody torso.

		DefaultEvent
Name:The Skull and the Spiral
Id:159514
Description:"...no! not a pale-fleshed beast, but a skull, grinning ruefully atop the pillar as if apologising for the quality of its welcome. We spent the afternoon deciphering the inscription, which had elements in common with Aramaic. I say 'deciphering' - it was a looped set of riddles which left us with as many questions as answers. It cryptically described the exploits of the woman whose skull remained atop the Pillar, and her progress into the East, far past Irem..."

		DefaultEvent
Name:A perilous treasure
Id:159515
Description:"...parasitic solacefruit, which grows on whatever tree takes its fancy. It clustered on their trunks like the primitive eyes of certain insects. We plucked it cautiously. Inside one fruit I found no stone, rather a diamond the size of the top joint of my little finger. But as I plucked it, the trees trembled again, and their roots began to rise from the mud! - be assured we did not remain..."

Description:"A bleating billy with moss-matted fur staggered to and fro, eyes wide. A chain hung from its neck. The chain bore a lump of piercingly blue scintillack, the source of the stutters of light as the billy staggered along the path. We freed the billy and retrieved the Scintillack. A rare piece like this is valuable..."

Name:A disappearance
Id:159500
Description:Your zailors wade in, guns held above their heads. Ripples spread, intersect, travel on into darkness. Bats chirp with derision as you pass.

Dispatch it!
