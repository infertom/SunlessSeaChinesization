Description:The figures are rodents! To your left is a Rattus Faber, wearing goggles, a blacksmith's apron, and an assortment of tools; to your right is an unusually large guinea pig, wearing a helmet and breastplate reminiscent of nothing so much as the High Middle Ages.

The rat steps forward first, and bows. 
<br><br>
"Welcome, Captain, to Rat Star Island. I am Edgar, Second Chief Engineer of the Third Rat Brigade. I invite you to avail yourself of food and fuel at our expense; the only cost to you is a choice."
<br><br>
The rat steps back; at precisely the same moment, with what appears to be the ease of long habit, the guinea pig scuttles forward, and makes a declamatory chirp.
<br><br>
"Welcome, Captain, to the Isle of Cavia. I am Lady Augusta Devereaux Swinch of the Blackwater Swinches, Seneschal to our King Gracegnaw, First of His Name. I invite you to avail yourself of food and fuel at our expense; the only cost to you is a choice.‚Äù
<br><br>
The two stand at attention, looking at you expectantly.

Description:Sea-monsters, faceless predators, screaming oceans, yes. But you draw the line at talking to guinea-pigs in full armour. Back on your ship you go.

Description:"We'll be here if you return," one of them chirrups as you stomp back down the quay - the guinea-pig, you think. Of course they will. Where else are they going to go?
