Name:For the eyes!
Id:155734
Description:That fat spider with the overdeveloped fangs - it was sucking merrily on Seaman Carrilo's bicep before you smashed it. They eat whatever flesh they can find (poor Carrilo, still moaning from the poison's ravages!). But again and again they leap for the eyes. Do they prefer the taste? Is it a tactic? Or do they have an even more disgusting purpose in their dim arachnid minds?
