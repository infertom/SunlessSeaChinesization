Description:Isery snatches the notes from your hands, and starts flicking through the pages. "I'll have a reward sent to your ship." They look up and smile at you vaguely, eyes glazed as a honey-seeker's. "Oh, my dear, what a treasure you are."<br><br> You summon an answering smile, and slip away the moment they are distracted.
