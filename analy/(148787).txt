Name:Invite her to dine with you
Id:127625
Description:"Captain's cabin, is it? All right. But I want a coffee sorbet for dessert. What? I like coffee sorbet. No sorbet, no dinner. 'Scuse me. Someone's caught fire again."

		DefaultEvent
Name:A pleasant evening
Id:148791
Description:"Yes, I was in the Navy. Did you think I'd stolen the uniform? I retired before they threw me out." She grins and spoons more sorbet on to her plate. "I'm older than I look. We're all older than we look, to you people."

Id:144721
Description:"One day, I'll be tired of coffee sorbet." She smiles. "Not today."

		DefaultEvent
Name:A troubled evening
Id:177787
Description:She's obviously distracted. Halfway through her dessert, she loses the thread of the conversation, snaps her spoon in half, apologises, flings the spoon across the room, apologises again and pushes the rest of the sorbet away.
<br/><br/>
"Sorry," she growls. "I can't concentrate. You know why? I'm getting old. My bloody father. You know what the College of Mortality is? Our very own elected Hell. They choose our king. They tell us when to die. He cheated them. So now I'm getting old."
<br/><br/>
She drains her glass. "Old. Too old. I'll see you in the morning." She rises to her feet with uncharacteristic clumsiness and stumbles out, but not before you've seen the tears in her eyes.

		DefaultEvent
Name:"None shall live a thousand years."
Id:177794
Description:"In the Presbyterate, in the South, we're close to the Mountain and far from the Sun. So we could live forever, were that permitted. It isn't. The law is ‘none shall live a thousand years."
<br/><br/>
"My father made it to a thousand and eleven." She grins with shame-faced pride. "Good for him. Bad for his children. The law for me is 'thou shalt not live a hundred years’. I'm out of time. That's why I left the Navy. The College will get to me - they always do in the end - and I can't keep letting other people die for me."
<br/><br/>
She stands to go. "Will you help me find a way to die well? In battle would do. Or a duel. I don't want to be - oh, you know. Just shot by a pirate. Eaten by a shark. I want people to talk after I'm gone." She offers you her hand. "I'm sorry."

		DefaultEvent
Name:Zailor's Tales
Id:177959
Description:"...a ship of lights, beautiful as a palace - until we heard the screams across the water... the heptycheer rose like a moon, fingers flexing huge as rowboats... the rats singing the hymns of their ancestors, until they sank one by one... when the way to the Ragged Crow opened, and we went up the stairs together to the light... the days before the Dawn Machine, when the passage was calm and dark..."

Name:Hard lessons
Id:178066
Description:"I learnt this in the Corsair's Forest. (That's how I got this scar.) I learnt this from an Iremi Riddlefisher who'd turned cannibal. (That's when I started collecting riddles.) <i>This</i> - ha, nearly! - I picked up from the Pirate-Poet herself. (No, we don't have time to talk about that.) And this - you didn't see it coming, did you? - is all my own."
<br/><br/>
By the end, you're both bruised and aching. "I can't tell," she remarks, "what this might have done to my chances. Perhaps I should just have got a good night's sleep."

Name:"Why not?"
Id:178067

<br/><br/>
A rap on the door: it's the Brisk Campaigner. She glances archly at you. "Back by midnight," the Adventuress says with a grin. "We can talk then."

Id:145001
Description:The Presbyterate extends deep into the Elder Continent. Outsiders are not often permitted within its borders. What will she share?

		DefaultEvent
Name:The Kingdom of Life
Id:178245
Description:"...each Presbyter is different, but each takes the identity of the last. Presbyters never truly die, even after a thousand years. At their 'deaths' they give up their names to join the College, who live nameless. The rebels who serve the Thief-of-Faces - they live faceless. I'm no friend to the College, you know that, but they have served our realm well - they are just..."
<br/><br/>
"... it's true: we eat the flesh of the beasts we hunt, as do you. But we will kill nothing that flies. The story is that they carry the airs of the Garden, that permit us to live forever. But I think it's sentiment. I think the Mountain dreams of flight..."
<br/><br/>
She speaks casually, but now and then, a tear crosses the sharp planes of her face to fall unnoticed into the dark.

Name:A closely fought battle
Id:177788
Description:She's strong. But you're stronger. She's a good sport, but she seems more depressed than you might have expected. Halfway through the sorbet, loses the thread of the conversation, snaps her spoon in half, apologises, stares moodily out of the port-hole, flings the spoon-fragments across the room, apologises again and pushes the rest of the sorbet away.
<br/><br/>
"Eh, snuff it," she growls. "I'm getting old. I shouldn't be. My bloody father. You know what the College of Mortality is? Our very own elected Hell. They choose our king. They tell us when to die. He cheated them. So now I'm getting old."
<br/><br/>
She drains her glass. "Old. Too old for this. I'll see you in the morning." She rises to her feet with uncharacteristic clumsiness and stumbles out, but not before you've seen the tears in her eyes.
