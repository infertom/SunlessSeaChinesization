Name:"A melancholy tale."
Id:183098
Description:"She was a smuggler of our honey, this zee-captain: and also a gambler, and a frequent visitor to the Tongue. Her debts became so onerous that I had to take her in keeping. Her family paid the ransom to redeem her, but - oh dear, let me be honest with you - I was a little short of operating funds that month. So I sold her to Zaira, for the Garden of Cages." They smile. "The bees have been into her - who knows how many times? There is nothing left now. She won't remember her name, much less the key-phrase."
<br/><br/.
"I suppose that's not what you were hoping to hear, is it? I am sorry. At least let me give you the address of her family, in London. I do regret I couldn't be of more assistance."
