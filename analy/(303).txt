Name:DELIVERIES
Id:146637
Description:There are no stevedores, however, and no wagons waiting to help with the heavy cargo. There is only a sign, which reads DELIVERIES, and a painted hand which points, insolently, up a rock-cut staircase.

Description:There is cargo in the hold marked for this destination. A long, low, heavy box. It'll be fun getting it up the stairs, no doubt.

Name:Up a twisting staircase
Id:146638
Description:There's a great deal of grumbling from the crew. The stairs are sharp-edged and wet. The box is heavy, and its contents inclined to shift. After a few slips and a bad bruise to the shin, you resort to placing crew-members along the stairs and handing the box along.

<br/>
There is a warehouse at the top of the stairs, but it is not, apparently, your destination. Another sign points along the narrow path towards the building with the spire. DELIVERIES! it says, more aggressively this time.
<br/>
<br/>
Someone in the spired building is singing. The song sets your teeth on edge.
