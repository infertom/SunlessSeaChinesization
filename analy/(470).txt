Name:Compile a Port Report
Id:138375
Description:The silk-traders are back at work. It's lonely and isolated work though; a trade of news should go down well.

		DefaultEvent
Name:An off-the-cuff, scripted response
Id:167330
Description:The silk traders don't talk much. In particular, they don't talk of the sorrow-spiders at their feet, over their heads or crawling over them as they sleep. Spiders? We'll not be having that kind of talk about the generous neighbours, they say with haste, in raised voices.

Id:180509
Description:The Haunted Doctor hurries aboard the ship. He pauses, looking at the cursed wasteland of Saviour's Rocks. "The Lady said I would never be able to get it back once it was thrown away. I see she was... never mind. Is this my cabin? Yes. It is more than I deserve."

Description:Dark and dank: just how they like it.

		DefaultEvent
Name:An unseemly brawl
Id:182368
Description:The blemmigan whirls across the quay and under a silk-merchant's stall, occasioning some alarm. Gone from your life! Your duty is done!
<br/><br/>
Not quite. With a furious insectile screech, sorrow-spiders converge on the stall. The blemmigan is driven into the open! It smashes one spider-carapace with its beak, vaults another spider in a flash of fungal dexterity, fences tendril-to-chelicerae with a third as they both dash up a wall. Then it's gone into the webs, its hyphal slimes protecting him from their sticky adhesions. Spiders pour after it. Who will know its end? Not you. You had nothing to do with this. If anyone asks, you were probably never even here.
