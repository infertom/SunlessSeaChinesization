		DefaultEvent
Name:The map reads as follows...
Id:178362
Description:North for each City the bats have brought down<br />
Then East to the river where no man fears to drown<br />
Venture south for each island the Empire can claim<br />
And west for each bearer of the Emperor's name<br />
Head straight for the Horizon, then take a step more<br />
Letting west end your search, with a one, two, three...<br /> 
In the shape of an X, find a seeker misled<br />
Nothing but eternity belongs to the dead
