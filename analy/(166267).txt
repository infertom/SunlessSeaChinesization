Id:167214
Description:With SAY, help at the festival, then with a second SAY, meet the Emissary of Spiders to unlock the first assignment - bringing Tomb Colonists to feed the spider-council on the web-linked island.
<br /><br />
Bring the Tomb Colonists. Sorry. Got to be done!
<br /><br />
In the Web of Stone, either spy to get background on the story or skip the timer ahead to meet with the spider council and be sent to the Nocturne.
<br /><br />
COMING SOON: At the Wreck Of The Nocturne, explore until you get the Scholar's Diary.
<br /><br />
COMING SOON: Return to the Web Of Stone
<br /><br />
OPTIONAL: Rescue the Captain of the Nocturne
<br /><br />
Return to the Nocturne
<br /><br />
Fight a Lorn Fluke (Note: Failure is impossible, but success offers bonus treasure. Having the Captain on board gives a bonus to skill checks)
<br /><br />
Return one last time to Saviour's Rocks for the Festival of Silk and the quest reward.
<br /><br />
Alternate path - burn the tree at the Web of Stone. This changes the Nativity and makes the Scuttering Reaches far more dangerous.
