Name:Jillyfish Passing
Id:168000
Description:It was a colossus of toxic tentacles, capped with hardened ramming-goo. Now it's a smear on the ocean's surface. Jillyfish dissolve in minutes once they're dead.

Description:It will wait in the hold like a cup of dissolved moon. One day, you will eat it. Or, perhaps, it will eat you. And this purple thing. Is it an egg? A heart? A less fortunate traveller, dissolved and shrivelled to mauve ruin? Put it somewhere safe.

Description:From above, the jillyfleur's cap does look a little like a woman's face. She dissolves like smeared paint.

Name:A face!
Id:168006
Description:It looks very like Flourishing-of-Years - the grand shrine-face of Visage. Something about the eyes, the sternness of the mouth. Perhaps only that it stares at the roof, just as Flourishing-of-Years does. Now it dissolves. You could swear it's mouthing a word. "HOME"...?
