Name:Attend a Funeral Feast
Id:181066
Description:The Replete occupy lofty positions in the Presbyterate's military. Despite their sanguinary past, they dine with the Prester and send their children to be educated at London's University. However, they maintain their tradition of eating their dead.
<br/><br/>
The feasts are held in public. Here in a broad square stretches a splendid table. The departed was only a distant relative - some great-aunt or second cousin - and the atmosphere is jolly. Servants carry the deceased over in steaming joints, cooked to perfect pinkness. A stately mourner stands, already wobbly from wine. "Shall I carve?"

Description:A Plummy Anthropologist cranes her neck for a better view. "This isn't normal here, you know," she tells you, noticing your interest. "The other nations of the Presbyterate think they're crackers. Still, I bet the Prester finds them useful. The threat of imminent cannibalism must facilitate no end of diplomatic negotiations." 
<br/><br/>
A salt-cellar passes along the table. Napkins dab at mouth-corners. The anthropologist is warming to her subject. "I hear the practice began with one of their forebears who zailed into the far North. I may have to take a trip that way. See what it's like for myself."

<br/><br/>
Afterwards, you are given a keepsake: a knob of bone, engraved with the date. You accept it with good grace. Is that one of your crew among the gawkers, watching you with horrified eyes?

Description:You edge closer, your eye on a discarded ulna lying forgotten beside a chair leg. Too slow - an unctuous servant sweeps it up. Some of the feasters have noticed your encroaching lurk. You feign innocence. Is that the time? You have somewhere to be.

Id:181178
Description:A darting lunge seizes you a bone clung with stringy tatters of flesh. You hide it under your jacket and return to your cabin, where you hold a meagre feast of your own. 
<br/><br/>
The meat is unremarkable. When it's gone, you crack the bone open to get at the marrow. You force it all down - every mealy scrap. Was there any virtue in it? Are you changed?
