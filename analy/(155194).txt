Description:The gold needle pricks. Lily Clathermont hums. The design is complete: a ship's wheel, but with a curious elaboration to the design, like an optical illusion. "We are not the messenger but the message," Lily intones. You frown. She dimples. "Oh, all right, that's just something Mr C. says to sound impressive. I don't know what it means. But I like the design."

Description:The gold needle pricks. Lily Clathermont hums. Is that... butter on the chess knight's head? She shrugs. "The ways of the Great Game are tangled." She doesn't seem to be mocking you. A pop-eyed Pole across the parlour sees your new tattoo, hisses and ducks his head in respect.
