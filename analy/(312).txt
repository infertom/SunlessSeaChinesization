Name:Culinary philosophies
Id:152798
Description:"To be edible, is to be possible to be consumed. And to be living, is to consume. Thus we find that the nature of the unliving is to <i>be</i> consumed. In fact, therefore, anything that is not living may be consumed - "

Id:146198
Description:"Ah, no no no, my captain! <i>You</i> shall dine with <i>me</i>!"

		DefaultEvent
Name:The great work
Id:180267
Description:Your companion barely eats. He has to cut the fish into tiny morsels to squeeze it through the gap in his bandages. Soon the cloth is stained with sauce. He throws down his fork. "Look at me. I am not at my best, no? Believe me, your appetite would not be so strong if I removed my bandages. How long before my fingers fail? Or my tongue pickles?" 
<br/><br/>
He swirls his wine. "Captain: a request. I have cooked for barons and bishops. The Khan. The Empress. But there is one for whom I have not cooked. A creature of singular and <i>acroamatic</i> tastes. I want to make him marvel! The chef's art is alchemy, and this would be my philosopher's stone. My immortality. Will you aid me?" [Bring your chef Strange Catches and Live Specimens to further his research.]

Name:Hand over a Strange Catch for his culinary masterpiece
Id:147215
Description:"Hello, little fellow. Let us see what delights you hold." His filleting knife gleams. [This is a matter of luck. He will need at least two useful ingredients.]

		DefaultEvent
Name:Disappointment
Id:181861
Description:"Alas. Too ordinary." The flesh goes onto his shipboard athanor-stove: an edifice of his own invention that combines the functions of roasting and refinement. Steam rises. The crew lick their lips.

Name:Promise!
Id:181862
Description:He tastes a morsel on the tip of his knife, and shudders. "An exquisite find, my captain. Like a devil's lips. Searing. Probably fatal. But utterly worth the risk."

Name:Turn over a Live Specimen for his culinary masterpiece
Id:147259
Description:"Wonderful! The fresher the better! Hold it down a moment. I will need to fetch the larger of my mandolines." [This is a matter of luck. He will need at least two useful ingredients.]

		DefaultEvent
Name:Excellent, but not exemplary
Id:181932
Description:He grunts in disappointment. "It is merely delicious. I need <i>extraordinary</i>. I suppose that -  served as a mousse on lightly-crusted biscuit with a little lemon - it would be acceptable to simpler palates." Your crew enjoy the fruits of his disappointment.

Name:A useful ingredient
Id:181933
Description:Tasting it, he makes a strangled noise. Have you poisoned him? "No, no. Or if so, poison of the finest sort! Like bee-stings in sugar! Or honeyed scalpels! Yes, this. This!"

Name:He pokes his head from the galley
Id:147260
Description:"Have you my mutersalt, captain? My zzoup? I am keen to investigate their possibilities." A braising-alembic bubbles eagerly in the background.

		DefaultEvent
Name:Supplies
Id:181934
Description:"Excellent!" He retreats into his galley and bars the door. Day and night his jugging-crucible blazes. The galley portholes flare crimson across the black zee. He does not answer the door. It's ship's biscuits and barrelled water for a while.
<br/><br/>
When he emerges, his bandages are yellow with smoke. "I am victorious! The zzoup defied me, but I have broken it. Chantarelles from some soggy edge of London. Pig stock. A feisty dash of paprika. Lament-onions. Petals from the exile's rose, which grows in Hell. And tears! From a hanged man or a heartbroken priest - I believe either would suffice. The method of the ingredients' combination is singular. I believe I can make use of it. We are charting new culinary frontiers, my captain, but the Fathomking presides over the Drowning Feasts. He is accustomed to excess. We must amaze."
<br/><br/>
That night, the crew dine happily on fish stew. The Poissonnier keeps your wine glass topped up, and at the end of dinner approaches you nervously. "I am afraid I have another request, captain. I need something from Khan's Heart. A certain... book of recipes. If we were going that way..." He fidgets with the ends of his bandages, avoiding your gaze. Why is he lying to you?

Name:The final piece
Id:181935
Description: "Ah! He is magnificent! Come, my solemn, feathered compatriot. Let us work wonders. We will be the best of friends. For a little while." They vanish inside. The bird's poetry, even muted, does little to improve the mood of the crew. Several days later, the Poissonnier throws a sack of feathers overboard, yet somehow gloomy couplets continue to drift from the galley's porthole. "Ah, captain. All is ready. Although we will need wine. Lots of wine." [Procure 5 crates of Mushroom Wine and make your way to the Fathomking's Hold.]

Id:181936
Description:"Marvellous! Bring it in. Forgive me if I do not help. The irrigo is potent, and it would not do for me to forget a vital step in the preparations. Zail for the Fathomking's Hold, my captain! I will begin my work." He snaps his fingers, remembering something. "Oh!  And we will need wine. Lots of wine."[Procure 5 crates of Mushroom Wine and make your way to the Fathomking's Hold.]

Description:"The ingredients are fine, it is my hands that are deficient! There are piquant jewels hiding in the vitals of these creatures, but I cannot extract them! One slip, and the taste is contaminated."

He paces the galley. "I need to improve my butchery. Can you take me to the Chelonate? No one knows more about gutting than the Bone Men."

Description:"My business there should not take long. I only need to retrieve an old recipe book." He twiddles a loose bandage-end nervously. "It contains certain... ah... formulae and distillations I will need for the feast. Yes." He is an exceptional chef, but a poor liar.

Description:After his visit to the Khanate he is more fixated, less congenial. He corners you below decks, his eyes fervent between his wrappings.

Name:Is that all?
Id:182201
Description:"I need a capstone for the feast, captain. Something unforgettable. I have a vision - no, two! One demands the core of a lorn-fluke. The other requires a certain bird of the Elder Continent: a cockatoo, given to funereal poetry. I have heard a certain southern showman owns such a creature." He waves a casual hand. "Either would do - do not trouble yourself with both." [Acquire a Colossal Fluke-Core or Elegiac Cockatoo.]
