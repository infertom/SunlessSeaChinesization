Name:The Tree of Ages
Id:167777
Description:No longer just a legend. The cursed octomaran has come for blood, its silk sails blazing the purest red and its webbed hull alive with crawling sorrow-spiders.

Description:There's enough fight left in you, and they are allies. Of a sort. For the moment. You have to hope.

		DefaultEvent
Name:The Lorn-Fluke screams
Id:167778
Description:Your guns pound into it from one side. Cultists attack from the other. Sorrow-spiders digging into their minions' eyes guide them as they sink in serrated harpoons tied to silken ropes, wound tightly around their ship. The Avaricious Lorn-Fluke fights, pitting all its power against the Tree of Ages' might, but it is no good. It cannot submerge. It cannot escape!
<br /><br />
Thousands... perhaps even more... of vicious sorrow-spiders flock onto its back, tearing at its spines and sinking in their poisonous teeth. The Lorn-Fluke shrieks and buckles but can do nothing to stop the onslaught. Finally, exhausted, it can do nothing but be dragged towards whatever fate awaits it in the dark coves of Saviour's Rocks.
<br /><br />
There is a splash as one of the cultists throws a small token of appreciation for your extra assistance.

Name:Stay out of the fight
Id:138644
Description:This is not your ship, or your battle. The Nocturne is barely holding together as it is.

		DefaultEvent
Name:The Lorn-Fluke screams
Id:167779
Description:There is no need for your assistance. Cultists aboard the Tree of Ages soon have it pinned with vicious, serrated harpoons fired deep into its flesh. Sorrow-spiders in their hollow eyes guide their movements as the silken ropes drag on the Lorn-Fluke and pit its power against the Tree of Ages' mighty engines, preventing its escape.

Name:The zee is quiet once more
Id:138645
Description:All is still. All is well. A relief. The Nocturne would not survive another encounter.

		DefaultEvent
Name:A boatload of questions
Id:167780
Description:So much for the sorrow-spiders being interested in the Nocturne. If it had any secrets, surely they would be acquiring them now. It must be about the Lorn-Fluke. But why?
<br /></br />
In any event, the Nocturne will never make it to Saviour's Rocks in its current condition. Its original resting place seems as fitting a grave as any, and is close enough to rendezvous with the rest of the crew.
