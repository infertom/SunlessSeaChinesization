Name:Avid Horizon
Id:153237
Description:Two vast winged shapes guard a gate of something like resin, smooth but uneven. It is deep gant - the colour that remains when all other colours have been eaten. Ice crusts over the crack between its valves. Approach, and your breath freezes, falls tinkling in shards from the air. It would be utterly foolish to touch the thing.
<br/><br/>
A merciless wind blows from everywhere to everywhere. It passes without effort through your bridge-coat, your flesh, your lungs. The dock lies empty.

Name:Open the High Gate
Id:130398
Description:A curious miscellany, gathered from all across the wide black zee. Your companion knows how to use these materials. [Complete a certain matter in London to achieve this.]

		DefaultEvent
Name:Almost there.
Id:153238
Description:Most of the supplies remain packed. The Venturer extracts gems, wire, bone. At the base of each statue, he constructs a kind of cage. At the heart of each cage is a candle. "We won't light them," he tells you confidentially. "We'd be seen. The Gate only opens when the Watchers are blind..."

Name:Retrieve Strategic Information
Id:130399
Description:From here? But you were given a sign to look for. There it is, carved on one of the pillars of the dock.

		DefaultEvent
Name:Pleas for clemency
Id:153239
Description:Below the sign, an authoritative hand has carved this message: IF YOU WISH TO RETURN TO LONDON - IF YOU SEEK THE FORGIVENESS OF THE EMPRESS - IF YOU WILL SACRIFICE ALL TO MAKE AMENDS - RECORD YOUR NAME AND CRIME.
<br/><br/>
Below are the names of murderers, traitors, hopeless villains who've fled into exile. They've made the icy pilgrimage here, to the end of the world, to prove their desperation to return home. You record them all, the old and the freshly carved. The Admiralty will pick through the names and make their choice. Leave now: quickly.

Name:Look into the stars
Id:130400
Description:Stars float in the mirrored night of the waves. Watch them a while.

		DefaultEvent
Name:Peace beneath the world
Id:153240
Description:These are real stars. They burn above the roof of the Neath, beyond the earth, in the spaces of heaven. Even so far away, even now, their eyes are on you - but here in the night under the world, you are safe - safe -
<br/><br/>
You return to your senses, gasping. Your hands are cold, numb. How long were you watching the stars?

Name:Gather intelligence
Id:131307
Description:...such as there is to gather, out here where nothing moves.

		DefaultEvent
Name:Nothing moves.
Id:154675
Description:This stillness is itself of interest to the Admiralty. It is not impossible someone foolish might attempt to open the gate. It is not inconceivable that it might open from the other side. And what then?

Name:Put a blemmigan ashore
Id:133909
Description:Though it's far from hospitable...

		DefaultEvent
Name:Probably not
Id:158883
Description:The blemmigan, eyeless as it is, looks to you, looks to the shore, looks back to you. Its reaction is quite clear: it's not going anywhere near this place.

	ChildBranches7
Name:You heard a story...
Id:133966
Description:The ice by the gate's edge. There was a whisper about a hunting-quest, and a final revenge.

		DefaultEvent
Name:Behind the ice
Id:158972
Description:Yes. Yes, this is what the rumours meant. A hunter frozen in the ice, hands contorted to claws, mouth agape. With her left hand, she had plucked her own eye from the socket. It lies very close to the surface of the ice.
<br/><br/>
If the stories are true, there's a dark virtue in that eye. Take it, then. But perhaps you should put it in a jar.

Name:Explore along the shoreline
Id:146494
Description:What can be found on this bleak beach?

		DefaultEvent
Name:An abandoned expedition
Id:180749
Description:A ragged tent flaps in the freezing wind. Ice-encrusted bones lie tumbled at the flap. Someone came here to be forgotten.

Name:A shipwreck
Id:180750
Description:Beneath the black and freezing water, a ship lies rusting. Its hull has been torn like paper - lifebergs' work? Some of the supplies and cargo are salvageable. Why were they bringing sapphires here?



	ChildBranches9
Name:Lead the Sigil-Ridden Navigator to a certain dock-pillar
Id:147449
Description:Scraps of paper - stiff with northern frost - are stuffed into its cracks.

		DefaultEvent
Name:Unforgiven
Id:182212
Description:A message is carved into the wood: IF YOU WISH TO RETURN TO LONDON - IF YOU SEEK THE FORGIVENESS OF THE EMPRESS - IF YOU WILL SACRIFICE ALL TO MAKE AMENDS - RECORD YOUR NAME AND CRIME.
<br/><br/>
Your Navigator hunts through the slips of paper. They are a library of villains and villainy: here are murders, betrayals, treasons and perjuries.  He stops, stares at one, pulls it free. "This is mine," he says. "I wrote this." It is a confession. Beneath, in more recent and less careful letters, he has added a note: <i>You did not answer. If I cannot be forgiven, then I will forget. The Chapel of Lights will help me, for a price.</i>
<br/><br/>
He laughs, wildly. "Twice! I paid them twice! Once to take my memories, and once to guide me back to them!" His laughter deepens to hysteria. Two crewmen help you drag him back to your ship. [Speak to your Navigator on board to learn of his confession.]
