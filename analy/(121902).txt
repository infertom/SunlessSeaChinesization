Name:Iron & Misery Company Funging Station
Id:121902
Description:I & M has a funger operation here, felling giant bolegus shrooms for building materials, harvesting kirralee for its 'medicinal' properties. It's a desperate little outpost of something like civilisation.

Up puffs the Affable Factor. "Oh hello, Captain! Thank God for visitors. We'd go quite mad out here otherwise, ahahaha. Quite mad. How can we be of assistance?"

Description:"Here. Little to report, but we have had Khanate privateers nosing around. And tell them that the Company grows suspicious. Mr Iron knows the Admiralty is interested in his business. Pray, my friend, that you never have to serve two masters, as I do."

Description:The poor fellow needs the company, and he can spare an hour away from his schedule.

		DefaultEvent
Name:An interlude
Id:121904
Description:You sit on the verandah of the Factor's house, looking out over the fungal jungle: an expanse of green and sour gold. The air is thick with hovering spores. The scones are stale. Even the tea has a hint of mildew. But the Factor is good company: he shares odd stories about the ice and roses of Irem, the monstrosities of the Sea of Lilies, and a little restaurant in Venderbight where he enjoyed the most extraordinary sea-food. ("Venderbight! I know! I'd never met a tomb-colonist who could cook! But you must visit the place. Do you know it?")
<br/><br/>
He also has a load of bolegus-frond carted aboard your ship. He waves away your thanks. "I have eaten so much of the stuff I fear that I might be transformed entirely into fungus." He leans confidentially towards you. "It happens, you know. But one does have to eat rather a lot of it first."

Name:A kind of homecoming
Id:158884
Description:The blemmigan propels itself into a springing leap: up to a bolegus trunk, around, into the thickets. It whistles as it goes, and deeper in the fungal jungle, a whistling rises in response. There are already blemmigans here.

Description:Even with the bribe, the Factor is reluctant to talk - but it seems the Cannoneer knew him 'in the old days', and he's even more reluctant to have the Cannoneer talk about the old days. Finally, he gives in.

"It was a place called Aestival. Do you know it? It's, hm, a striking place. You wouldn't believe me if I told you. It's east. A long way east. We took it off all the maps. Not that maps last at zee anyway. That's all I know. Now - shall we let the past lie where it fell?"
