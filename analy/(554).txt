Name:Frostfound
Id:143337
Description:Towers and ramps and galleries and stairs of ice, raised and spun like an architect's honey-dream. No spider ever wove so complex a web. The towers are utterly pristine, untouched by human life, but a pitiable encampment squats by the dock.

Name:Take tea with the squatters at the dock
Id:124066
Description:Some of them wear the robes of Iremi Riddlefishers; some look like Whithern folk, but even more ragged. But they do seem a little more practical than either of those peoples.

		DefaultEvent
Name:A surprisingly warm welcome
Id:143338
Description:"We're keeping the steps for the Game of Truths," a Helpful Riddlefisher explains, as she fills your cup for the third time. "Every year, the people of Irem and Whither meet here, for - " she pauses. "Contests," she finished vaguely. "The difference between a question and a riddle. One day, someone will prove themselves enough to enter the castle."
<br/><br/>
You spend a pleasant few hours, while the tea is supplemented with Iremi liqueurs, pale Whithern beer, and something the Riddlefisher describes blandly as 'snake cake'. They offer you fuel and supplies before you leave. "We keep enough to spare," the Riddlefisher grins. "From time to time a captain gets lost and comes up here, and we always feel bad for them."

Name:Enter Frostfound
Id:124067
Description:A long flight of stairs rises glistening to a sheer tower. There is no door. Your reflection hangs in the cloudy ice. [You cannot enter Frostfound if your Terror is greater than 20; and you should not enter Frostfound without a good reason.]

		DefaultEvent
Name:Face the wall
Id:143339
Description:"You probably shouldn't do that," one of the squatters advises. Ignore her. Face the wall. Examine your cloudy reflection. Close your eyes. Step forward. Shiver. Frostfound radiates both cold, and a subtler chill of the heart.
<br/><br/>
Did you move at all? Or is it your reflection that moved? You are inside Frostfound.

Name:Allow the Sly Navigator to examine the tower
Id:146428
Description:He climbs the steps, panting eagerly. "This is the zee, you see?" he calls back. "The zee risen to become land. Ice is the zoul of the zee. In ice, we find the zee at her most exemplary -" And he's off again. You leave him to examine the tower, staring up at the battlements, his breath dragon-huffing.

		DefaultEvent
Name:Where is he?
Id:180635
Description:Only a few minutes later, you glance back, and the Navigator is gone. You climb the steps to examine the spot where you saw him last. His coat lies in the snow. His footprints end at the tower wall.
<br/><br/>
You poke through his coat and find a brass telescope from the Khanate, a much-annotated chart, tobacco, an alarming quantity of lice. But the Navigator is gone. You never see him again.

Name:Engage an Officer: the Tireless Mechanic
Id:146672
Description:"Afternoon. Ready to offer my services. I'm an engineer. Finest you'll ever hire. Treat engines like my own children. Not that I have children. Too busy. Usually busy." [The Tireless Mechanic increases Veils and Fuel Efficiency.]

		DefaultEvent
Name:Welcome aboard!
Id:181070
Description:"Spot of rust, spot of rust. Soon see to that. You there! Help me with this spot of rust."[Appoint your new Officer by dragging him from the Officers tab to his slot at the top of the screen. Do this in port, not at sea, or you may unsettle your crew.]

Name:Ask the squatters about the Castle
Id:147059
Description:You notice they avoid looking at it directly.

		DefaultEvent
Name:"If you can enter... you should not."
Id:181629
Description:"We get enthusiasts here, from time to time. Yes, you might be able to enter the castle before the appointed time. You might even find something of value there. But you'd be despoiling sacred ground, my friend. It will take your stories from you. It will take your essence, your self. And if you survive that, you'll likely anger the gods of the zee. Yes, they're real. As real as the corridors of Frostfound are. Stay away, my friend, stay away."

Name:Put a blemmigan ashore
Id:147300
Description:Snow, ice, a few squatters. A harsh environment for vegetation. But blemmigans are adaptable.

		DefaultEvent
Name:Not that adaptable
Id:181985
Description:Its moist tendrils freeze to the icy ground as soon as it's off the gang-plank. It squeals, speeding back into the ship to huddle in the engine-room. It's made its opinions on Frostfound very clear.

Name:Show the squatters your Navigator's sigil
Id:147448
Description:A Plucky Researcher recognises it. "I know it well! I can show you, but the way isn't easy. I'll not take anyone frail. You'll need ropes, crampons, skins, tents. And I'll want paying, of course - my bursary is wearing rather thin."

		DefaultEvent
Name:Almost Never Remembered
Id:182211
Description:He didn't exaggerate. The ice is slick as an oiled mirror. You need pitons and spiked boots to navigate the slopes, and a misplaced foot will send great chunks of it thundering into the thirsty sea. The air bites like a bound shark. Your face is numb, your fingers stiff, your throat raw. The climb takes you around a sheer white cliff, the waters below swimming with shards of razored ice.
<br/><br/>
At last, a frozen ledge. A vertical sheet of ice rises before you, reflective as a conjurer's glass. Engraved upon it, twenty feet high, is the Navigator's sigil. "Impressive, isn't it?" the researcher says, dropping his pack. "It's one of the old accords between Whither and Irem. It means <i>Almost Never Remembered</i>."
<br/><br/>
Your Navigator approaches it warily. The sigil on his temple sparks with blue fire. He reaches out, his fingers touching those of his reflection in the ice - and his reflection lunges forward, whispering something in his ear. The Navigator crumples into the snow. "Oh." The Plucky Researcher says. "Damn. We're going to have a devil of a time getting him back to the ship." You do. But you manage it.
<br/><br/>
Back in your cosy cabin you imbibe mulled rum. Will you ever be warm again? [Speak to your Sigil-Ridden Navigator to learn what happened.]

Name:Create a Port Report
Id:147486
Description:What are the squatters up to?

		DefaultEvent
Name:Bickering amiably
Id:182262
Description:Not all are Iremi or Whithern. There's the odd researcher, the occasional deranged ice-sculptor. Now and then a very cold, very sad Rubbery Man. But for the most part, an atmosphere of friendly rivalry reigns.

Name:Speak to your Iremi contact
Id:147208
Description:A Riddlefisher is wearing the blue-and-red scarf that marks him as a contact. It would be a Riddlefisher. What are the odds he'll give you a straight answer?

		DefaultEvent
Name:"When will the towers topple?"
Id:181851
Description:"Which Troy was drowned?" "How many battles until the Irridescence?" "Who went East?" Perhaps the Riddlefisher is trying to help. Perhaps they're trying to drive you out of your mind. You are forced to give up. The mission is a failure.

		SuccessEvent
Name:"When will the towers topple?"
Id:181856
Description:The Riddlefisher shares a series of linked riddles with you. You identify the linking factor: it's a prediction about who will win the Contest between questions and riddles, next year. Perhaps the Admiralty will find it useful. It's the closest thing to information about the balance of power, this far north.



	ChildBranches10
Name:Speak to a Whithern contact instead
Id:147209
Description:Interestingly, a Whithern dock-squatter is also wearing a red-and-blue scarf. What are the odds she'll give you an answer at all?

		DefaultEvent
Name:"Why would such a ship come here?"
Id:181852
Description:"Who questions the questioner?" "What is the name of your employer?" "Why do you think I would know?" Is she being obtuse? Are these code-phrases you don't recognise? Has the Khanate employed a counter-agent to bewilder you? Will these questions ever end? You are forced to give up. The mission is a failure.

		SuccessEvent
Name:"Why would such a ship come here?"
Id:181857
Description:The Whithern is even more elliptical than most of her kind. You realise quickly that she's trying to warn you off. There must be an enemy agent here. Take that information back to London. Sometimes the absence of an answer is an answer in itself.
