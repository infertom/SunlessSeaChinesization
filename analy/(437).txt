Name:The Vault of the First Emperor
Id:175835
Description:This tribute to the Empire's first and greatest has been constructed over generations by monkeys working with stolen ideas of what an ancient tomb <i>should</i> be.

Id:143983
Description:This part of the temple looks distinctly more ancient, and more carefully crafted by its architects. A sense of respect and history pervades.

		DefaultEvent
Name:The Hall of Histories
Id:176536
Description:A mosaic floor stands between you and the door. The Delightful Adventuress catches your arm before you can step onto it. "Oh, sweetie," she sighs, pointing at the walls. Little holes run down both of them, just large enough to see the readied crossbow bolts behind.
<br /><br />
"Isn't this <i>wonderful</i>?" she says. "I have seen many, many tombs, and most just put something big and heavy in front of the door. Bless their hearts for putting all this effort into something nobody was ever supposed to see. Anyway, be a dear. I will be outside if you need me."
<br /><br />
She heads back to check on her camp.

Name:An underground courtyard
Id:143984
Description:Down a flight of steps, the centre of the Vault

		DefaultEvent
Name:So close, and yet so far...
Id:176537
Description:This is very obviously the oldest part of the temple, around which all else has grown over time. Ancient tapestries hang from walls decorated with portraits of a single ape, clothed in violet and crowned by the sun. He is the First Emperor, the hundred-souled founder of the Empire of Hands. His authority reaches across time.
<br /><br />
"Not much to look at, is it?" declares the Delightful Adventuress. "They say they buried the old bugger with all of them. A hundred of the finest souls. A <i>heca-tomb</i> if you will." She laughs for a moment at a joke only she and perhaps three others in the Neath would appreciate. "Mark of respect by the primates, you know, to say no one else could do half as much with them."
<br /></br />
Her eyes glint. "Let's <i>do</i> something about that."

Id:143989
Description:What trials await through the... technically a doorway... over the melted cogs and fallen rubble?

		DefaultEvent
Name:A huge maze stretches out before you
Id:176543
Description:The Delightful Adventuress produces a large ball of yarn. "With all due credit to Theseus," she says, nailing one end into the wall. "I suspect however, we shall not have to worry about a Minotaur lurking in this particular maze. Come on! Such things are hardly a problem for a woman of adventure! This will take but a jiffy."
<br /><br />
She leads the way with utter confidence, even when it becomes clear she has no idea where she is going. Even when it becomes painfully obvious to all that she is merely turning left at every intersection, confident that eventually this will lead to the exit. The string runs out long before the maze does, yet somehow this does not feel like an insurmountable problem for returning.

Name:The Antechamber
Id:176576
Description:At the bottom of the stairs is a room with a sealed stone door. In front of that stands a pointedly placed plinth holding three thin pillars and some stone discs.
<br /><br />
The Delightful Adventuress rolls her eyes. "A Trial of the Mind, it appears. How very adorable. It appears that our monkey friends' ancestors have absorbed more than a few souls with a passion for things of the pulp. Oh, well. That should make things interesting."

She slaps your shoulder. "Do the honours, <i>kapitano</i>."

Id:176577
Description:Bits of rubble and clockwork fly. The stonework trembles slightly as if about to collapse, but then settles with just the occasional plink-plink of metal and the tinkle of falling shards and gears of all sizes.
<br /></br />
"Well, that is certainly one solution," declares the Delightful Adventuress, unplugging her ears. "I <i>think</i> though, darling, I shall be taking the rest of those. Cannot fault your thinking! But we would rather reach the centre of this quaint little tomb <i>without</i> ourselves becoming buried in it, would we not? Still, splendid resourcefulness. Splendid. Top marks."

"Ah, you, you're here," she calls. "Do pick up a crowbar, there's a dear. Bit of elbow-grease should do it."

		DefaultEvent
Name:"Right! On the count of three..."
Id:176579
Description:Muscles, human and primate alike, strain as the Delightful Adventuress harries everyone along. Finally, with a crack and a screech of triumph and exhaustion, the doors slide open. Inside is just blackness.
<br /><br />
"There! Now, chop-chop everybody!" declares the Delightful Adventuress, striding into the dark with a personal glim lantern. Behind her, her monkeys collapse to the ground gasping, occasional stolen words and squeals of protest escaping into the air.

		DefaultEvent
Name:Too far to jump

Name:The Final Door
Id:144022
Description:Huge. Imposing. Impassable. Is there a way through it?

		DefaultEvent
Name:There is no obvious method
Id:176582
Description:There is no handle, and though there is a gap that a crowbar could fit through, the door seems too thick to get any leverage. Scratch marks around the side suggest that more than a few monkeys have tried. Around it are gaping holes where gemstones were once seated.
<br /><br />
You press a hand to the door, holding a candle to the cracks. Stone. Very thick. Even dynamite is unlikely to make much of a dent without bringing the whole temple down around you. There must be a way to open it though. Why would anyone bother building a door that they never expected anyone to be able to get through?

		DefaultEvent
Name:You place the chip under your tongue
Id:176663
Description:It is not the usual rush of red honey, but a slow fizzling sense as it spreads through your mouth. For a moment, you have the sense of your body being too big, your blood pumping wrong. Memories hang at the edge of consciousness; unclear, faded. As you look at the inscriptions though, chaos melts into meaning.

		ParentEvent

	ChildBranches19
Name:Read the inscriptions
Id:144067
Description:The ancient carvings shift between complete nonsense and easy readability as the memories wax and wane.

		DefaultEvent
Name:A slightly dubious retelling of history
Id:176664
Description:A terrible light, cast from afar. A sliver of cosmogone in the darkness; burning cinders ashore the sea of the dead. The apes who are not yet of the Pentecost fear them, but their covetous natures will not be denied. Those who hold them burn harder, yet are cursed with tortured ambition no blood spilling can sate. It is an addictive melancholy. This is the Icterine Age.
<br /><br />
Uncounted times hence, he who will be the First Emperor is not yet the First Emperor. It is he who is first blessed to conquer the blue-clad emissaries from the waters of the dead, and drink deep of their stolen lifebreath by cinderlight. So dawns the Cerulean Age.
<br /><br />
The Pentecost's reach ensorcels the world, shore to shore, and all who are not ape are cast to the dark. The lifebreaths of emissaries from the waters of the dead have birthed the Empire Eternal in blood and light. All forever bask in the glory of the Amaranth Age.

Description:Its frozen memories glint in the candlelight.

		DefaultEvent
Name:A Test of Understanding
Id:176691
Description:The memories are diluted, largely unspecific. But that is not important. What this red honey carries is something far deeper; a connection of souls across centuries. The birth of an Empire in which even the lowest could be uplifted, and sparks of greatness itself passed on. Magnified. Never lost with the passing of flesh.
<br /></br >
This was the dream of the First Emperor; one of unity and evolution, transcendence and glory. His memory was placed here that all could see their true destiny. Purpose. Instead, it is as if the Emperor himself is receiving a glimpse of the Empire his dream became.

His tears run uncontrollably down your cheeks.

Id:176665
Description:The monkey tongue follows no apparent rules, being a creole of many and diluted with each new scribe. It would take someone capable of writing it to even stand a chance of decrypting it - but the age of the inscriptions and lack of anything similar elsewhere in the Empire of Hands suggests it is a long-lost art.

The Delightful Adventuress peers down. "Well, that is what happens when one decides to build oneself a fancy-dancy snake pit and neglects to think of a way for the poor darlings to be kept fed, isn't it? Come on then, get up from there! No sense being a big girl's blouse!"

<br /><br />
"Oh, do pay <i>attention</i>, darling," she sighs, shining her lantern on the snakes. The thousands of snakes. The thousands of venomous snakes. The thousands of... dead, dried-up snakes. "See, this is what happens when one decides to build oneself a snake pit, only to neglect to consider how the poor things will be fed. Seen it a hundred times! Well, perhaps twice." She chuckles.
