Name:Days with the Regiment
Id:148099
Description:The Gunner ran with the Regiment, the urchin-gang who keep a cannon in a high clock-tower. But the urchin-gangs reject adults, and now she plies her skills at sea. From the way she stumbles over the story, she still misses them.

Description:"It's like the Flit at zee, right? No one to tell yer what to say or do. And no one to kick yer downstairs, just 'cos you got a little bit tall. I'll be a faithful officer, but put me ashore at the Shadow, and I won't forget yer."

		DefaultEvent
Name:A tousled heap
Id:180761
Description:You bear her laughing to the bunk, where you both do your best to stifle the laughter. (It wouldn't do to have the crew overhear. An affair with an officer would cause trouble.) The Gunner is lean, forthright and energetic: you are exhausted by the time you both drift off to sleep.

[Opportunities for other trysts with the Gunner will occur while you're at sea, substantially reducing Terror. However, if you have a lover in port, they might find out.]
