Name:Whither
Id:143319
Description:Behind the great arch over the Bay, the Pale Wastes stretch, white and silent as the face of the moon. From here, you might almost imagine they were snow. North of the city, the salt-pools fizz with unlikely colour.

Name:Explore the town
Id:127781
Description:Whither is a quiet, chilly town of grey stone and closed courtyards. The people are neither exactly unfriendly nor exactly hospitable: they have the irritating habit of answering a question with a question. Here and there, there are odd sights tucked away...

Name:Gather intelligence
Id:127988
Description:The citizens of Whither enjoy questions: so much so that they always answer a question with another question. This can make intelligence-gathering frustrating.

		DefaultEvent
Name:
Id:149369
Description:"Are you asking for any particular reason?" "At what time of day?" "Is that your hat?" "Might it be six?" It could be six. Eventually you cobble together enough implication and supposition to compose a report.

Name:A Riddling Contact
Id:130378
Description:"Who seeks the ships?" "Is the Khanate our true enemy?" "What is the nature of sleep?" Ah yes. Whitherns only answer a question with a question. It's an annoying habit in a spy. Perhaps you can piece the report together.

		DefaultEvent
Name:Simple enough
Id:153210
Description:He's using a combination of codes and puzzles. Nothing that would inconvenience anyone who pays attention. Idiot. Still, you have your information now.

Name:A Riddling Contact
Id:130379
Description:Your contact's riddles make little sense to you. Perhaps you can combine them with the lore you've already learnt - [This will use up the Fragments.]

		DefaultEvent
Name:A long struggle
Id:153211
Description:Eventually you've teased the meaning out of his words. It's like trying to convince a cat to release a ball of wool. He's cat-smug, too. At last you have your information.

Name:Put a blemmigan ashore
Id:133914
Description:What questions might a blemmigan ask?

		DefaultEvent
Name:It is not enthusiastic
Id:158888
Description:It doesn't say anything, of course - but its opinion is apparent. "What the hell are you thinking?", perhaps. Ice, salt and dust are not to its taste.

		DefaultEvent
Name:The wind speaks
Id:182171
Description:You fall into a reverie as you wander the shore. There are words in the wind: a story of sorts, of a gate in the North, of a pale light that began there, of a drowned light that will end there, of a high wilderness that other ships may sail. You lift your eyes. On the wall of a salt-works, someone has scrawled IS THERE A SEA MORE SUNLESS?

Name:Shore leave in Whither
Id:124055
Description:The folk of Whither are quiet and sly and mystical. They subsist on cave-fish and the dust-burrowing beasts of the Waste. Their beer, however, is adequate.

		DefaultEvent
Name:"Keep a low profile."
Id:143321
Description:Your advice to your crew goes unheeded. One of them grows irritated at the Whithern habit of answering a question with a question. She punches the mayor's nephew in the nose, and is hauled off to gaol. You ask about the date of their release. When the Whithern constables respond with "What is the price of time?", "How can one measure freedom?" and "Why do you want to know?", you are sorely tempted to follow your crewman's example, but restrain yourself. You are forced, however, to sail without her.

		SuccessEvent
Name:"Keep a low profile."
Id:143700
Description:Your crew follow your example faithfully. One drinks a little too much pale Whithern beer and has to be fished from the harbour, but they spend a relatively decorous night gambling for salt and bone, and return refreshed.

Name:Help Maybe's Daughter search for her mother
Id:146192
Description:"I don't know why anyone would come here. But she does. Something about questions." The Daughter shivers. "You know: she asks people about love? All the time? And writes down the answers in her nasty little book. Love." The Daughter's mouth twists.

		DefaultEvent
Name:"NOTHING."
Id:180257
Description:"I have been asking QUESTIONS for THREE HOURS and every time I ask a QUESTION they reply with a QUESTION and I THINK I MIGHT - "
<br/><br/>
"Well, I might, but I didn't. I just picked their pockets. I think that's entirely reasonable under the circumstances, don't you? Here's your share. Let's go and look somewhere else."

		ParentEvent
Id:143319

		SuccessEvent
Name:"No luck. But - "
Id:180258
Description:You follow the Daughter's stunned gaze. A woman in a lilac gown leans in the doorway of a salt-merchant. Her features bear an unmistakable resemblance to your officer's. "We should talk," she says to the Daughter, quite calmly.
<br/><br/>
The Daughter assembles the rags of her composure with remarkable speed. "Excuse us," she says...
