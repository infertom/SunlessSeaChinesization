Name:STATION III
Id:147948
Description:Machinery hums behind high steel walls. Up the hill, there are visible outlines of warehouses and a building with a spire. But the lamps are low where they burn at all, and your ship the only one in harbour.

Description:Might be best to get a look from a distance.

		DefaultEvent
Name:Church? Or something else?
Id:148058
Description:You stand on the high point of your ship and look to shore. There is a steepled building on the horizon, by far the largest thing in sight. No cross marks the top of it, nor any other symbol you recognise.

Description:The only way past the walls is an unimposing, but sturdy-looking, triple-locked gate silvery metal. A sign beside it reads DELIVERIES. The gate stands open.

Name:Try the gate
Id:129948
Description:The only way past the walls is an unimposing, but sturdy-looking, gate of triple-barred silvery metal. A sign beside it reads DELIVERIES.

		DefaultEvent
Name:No way in
Id:152508
Description:The metal is steel-hard, and icy cold to the touch. Attempts with chisels and crowbars fail. Perhaps if you could bring the ship's guns to bear... but no.
<br/><br/>
[If you return with a certain delivery, the gate will be open. You'll know if you find it.]

Name:Put a blemmigan ashore
Id:147593
Description:What will it do, in this place of oil and metal?

		DefaultEvent
Name:A creeping plague
Id:182420
Description:The blemmigan sidles furtively into a pipe that protrudes from the wall. All is still. You see no more of it.
<br/><br/>
As you turn to go, greasy smoke puffs suddenly from the pipe's end. You smell burning grease. Nevertheless, perhaps, it survived.

Description:It never hurts to know what you are up against.

		DefaultEvent
Name:No evidence
Id:147955
Description:You walk the quays, looking for any little sign that might show what sort of ships dock here, and what they deliver. But you find nothing conclusive: not even so much as a smear of pitch or a damp footprint. If any ship but yours has been tied up here in recent days, it has left no evidence.

Name:A familiar smell
Id:147956
Description:There is nothing to see along the narrow quays, but there is a smell, distinct enough to rise above the odours of brine and wood and wet rope. It is the smell of frankincense, burned recently and in substantial quantities.

		RareSuccessEvent
Name:A familiar smell and an old brazier
Id:147957
Description:Here! A few quays over from the one where your own ship is docked, a brass burner is placed on a tripod. There's a heady scent of frankincense, and some sticky residue still clings to the bottom of the bowl. A scrap of gauze-thin black silk is tied to one leg of the tripod.
<br/>
This is an unusual amount of ceremony to attach to the unloading of a ship.

Name:An abandoned log
Id:148031
Description:A few pages torn from a log book record a long passage of doggerel that makes no sense at all. 
<br/>
The verses go on and on about purple fires and upside-down houses; a fistful of roses the color of brandy, and dolls with buttons for teeth. 
<br/>
The pages end just as they are reaching the nonsense refrain.

		RareSuccessEvent
Name:An abandoned log
Id:148032
Description:A few pages torn from a log book begin with a passage of music, a sweet low children's tune. After that come many verses that make no sense at all. 
<br/>
They go on and on about purple fires and upside-down houses; a fistful of roses the color of brandy, and dolls with buttons for teeth; the soft glossy pelt of an octopus and the sweet juice of a brazil nut.
<br/>
By the end you are humming along to yourself. It is terribly soothing, this song.

Name:A shattered box
Id:148035
Description:A box lies broken on the ground at one of the far quays. No one has cleared away the debris: a torn label reading SOOTHE & COO.... Curved shards of apothecary bottles. A curious oval of silvered metal the size of a cameo brooch.
