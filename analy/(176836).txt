Name:Deliver the box for the Monkey Emperor
Id:144189
Description:It does not specify who to deliver it to. It does say where. It is not a salubrious part of the city.

[If you do this, you will never be able to return to London again. You are committing yourself to stealing the Zeppelin and ending your career.]

Name:Anarchy reigns
Id:176837
Description:It is not the woman they call February who meets you. She is merely the one to whom you are taken, having been thoroughly interrogated by a pair of the least gentlemanly thugs in the service of the Calendar Council. She reads through the Emperor's documents with first suspicion, then a smirk. Finally, it is merely with glee, and a polite comment that your current state of consciousness is now surplus to requirements.
<br /><br />
In the days that follow, London burns. You see little of it from your windowless room, but overhear much and smell more than you would like. Eventually, you are released; a hated face racing to the docks and fleeing as fast as you can zail. Your life here is over.

Well, most of them. The important ones. But it would have been wrong not to take a little peek during the long voyage and make just a couple of notes...
