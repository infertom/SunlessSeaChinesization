Name:The Sundered Sea
Id:180348
Description:"There is another sea beneath the Bazaar," Penstock declares. "A paler sea. Yes, I would imagine you might make the bargain your mother made. Yes, I helped her go down there. But she took a terrible chance even then... and the Bazaar is not well. Not now. Are you certain?"

"This" is the Daughter's golden necklace. It's not gold, of course; it's silver-gilt.
