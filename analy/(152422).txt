Name:Returning to Varchas
Id:152422
Description:The walled city of Varchas is a tangle of green vines and luminescent fungal flowers slow-blooming around mouldering stone. A quincunx of carved stepped-towers rise over the walls and pour burning white light into the bleak sky. 
<br/><br/>
A rough, shadowed path leads from the docks to the Mirrored Gates of Varchas. Two towering carved-stone lamps throw their light on the angled mirrors, and a blue-cloaked Guard stands in the reflected pool of light. 
<br/><br/>
The city is a beacon against the tree-hushed, sprawling darkness of the Elder Continent. In the far distance a vast Mountain glimmers.

Description:Up close, the blue-cloaked Guard looks grimly fearful and wide-eyed. "There are...strange things going on in Varchas these days." She turns away. "Sometimes I think Mihir has turned his gaze away from us forever."
<br/><br/>
She seems to recollect herself all of a sudden, and stands a bit straighter. "You will see for yourself, Taamas. Step lightly, and walk in the light of Mihir."
