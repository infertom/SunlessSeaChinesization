Name:Apis Temple
Id:169902
Description:The priests gather around the bull, capturing its blood in cups.



	ChildBranches1
Name:Ask whether the bull will be all right 
Id:139879
Description:It doesn't look well.


		DefaultEvent
Name:Bad question
Id:169903
Description:The question displeases the priests. How ill-omened, even to suggest that the bull might die!
<br/><br/>
If it does die, of course (says one in an aside), there will be another born with the same markings, if not on Visage itself, then somewhere around the Unterzee. Apis is never gone, but sometimes his spirit goes astray. 
<br/><br/>
To show you the sort of markings they mean, they lift its tongue, and show you the jewel-coloured scarab on the underside. It looks more like a tattoo than a birthmark.
<br/><br/>
The bull rolls its eyes and pulls its head away.

Name:Offer to sell them a new, undamaged bull
Id:139881
Description:You could arrange an import through the proper contacts.



		DefaultEvent
Name:Perhaps not
Id:169905
Description:The priests are not impressed with the offer. Moon-Moths are not supposed to partake in commercial or religious endeavours. Besides, it's plain from your offer that you don't understand the requirements for identifying the Apis bull, including the important rule that there can be only one at a time.

	ChildBranches3
Name:Collect some of the blood for yourself
Id:139882
Description:Perhaps it is a holy relic. Perhaps it could be sold as one to unsuspecting buyers elsewhere.



		DefaultEvent
Name:The priests don't prevent you.
Id:169906
Description:But they aren't precisely pleased, either. In fact, they are highly suspicious of why Moon-Moth would want such a thing until you explain that you need it to educate some especially ignorant and impious visitors.
<br/><br/>
Then they let you go ahead.

Name:Leave a respectful token of offering
Id:139883
Description:Even wounded, it remains a god.

		DefaultEvent
Name:Impeccable
Id:169907
Description:The tokens are small and not very valuable, as suits your lower rank in the community. The priests arrange them on a table with other small items. 
<br/><br/>
As you go out, you pass by the more impressive gifts: drafting tools from the Chief Geometer, scales from Jackal, a heap of foreign coin brought home by Crocodile.

	ChildBranches5
Name:Observe and make notes
Id:139884
Description:The customs here may be worth reporting later.


		DefaultEvent
Name:You alone may act
Id:169908
Description:The priests would be suspicious of anyone else who did this. But you, as Moon-Moth, often have a need to narrate the rituals of Visage to newcomers. The explanations in the Library of Parts are not suitable for strangers, and therefore you are expected to compose your own.

	ChildBranches6
Name:Try to bandage the bull
Id:139880
Description:It is a shame to see it suffering so.

		DefaultEvent
Name:Bellowing and goring
Id:169904
Description:You try to bind up the wound, but the bull cannot bear to be touched, and you are forced to give up, as further experiments will end in your being gored as well. In any case, veterinary interventions are not a Moth-like function.

		ParentEvent
Id:169902

		SuccessEvent
Name:Out of character, but no one minds
Id:169911
Description:You do the task well. The animal stops the most distressing of its noises, and lies down.
<br/><br/>
The priests are suspicious. Medical knowledge is not a part of the etiquette of the Moth. On this one occasion, they are grateful enough not to have you removed, however.
