Name:You politely decline
Id:139085
Description:You are not entirely sure you wish an introduction to the Pirate-King, and you are not terribly keen on the transport of unwilling gifts, as it were. [Refusal will lock you out of this quest]

		DefaultEvent
Name:
Id:168579
Description:You see something wild and dangerous in Isery's eyes, but it is quickly replaced by genial disappointment. You are certain that your services will not be required again, and you cannot help the sense that you have been granted an unlikely reprieve.
