Name:Try something mysterious
Id:127974
Description:What exactly is 'tyrant's treat'? The vendor is vague. It looks something like a charred stick dripping with bluish fluid.

		DefaultEvent
Name:Hold your nose
Id:149352
Description:You follow the vendor's advice, holding your nose as you swallow, but the smell - something like rotting fruit - still makes you gag. The 'stick' is leathery - the blue stuff is rubbery as drying mucus. You fail to keep it down, and disgrace your captaincy there on the street.

Name:Rare and delicious!
Id:149353
Description:Tyrant-moth antennae! You know how to deal with these. You break it into fragments and swallow the dripping fragments each in a gulp, exhaling briskly to savour the vapours afterwards. It's a complex rather than a pleasant flavour, but its tonic effects are marvellous.

		DefaultEvent
Name:Force it down
Id:143930
Description:Urgh. You'll regret it later. The jillyfish's venom numbs your tongue and roils your stomach.

Name:Jillyfish: the food of queens
Id:149354
Description:Traces of its venom still remain - just enough to make your tongue tingle and alter your consciousness a touch. Your pulse accelerates, and odd thoughts sparkle in the forefront of your mind.
