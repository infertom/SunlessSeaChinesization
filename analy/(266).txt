Name:Escort her safely to the embassy
Id:147160
Description:The Presbyterate Embassy is hidden in London's sewers. The journey is damp and odorous.

		DefaultEvent
Name:The Prester's work
Id:181777
Description:Its location might be foul, but the embassy's door is good mahogany and the knocker has been polished to a fierce gleam. The Hands-On Diplomat stops outside. "Thank you for your help. The next task is mine." She hands you a shard of something bright and burning. "A sacred price, for enforcing a sacred prohibition."
<br/><br/>
She draws her gun and knocks on the door. You make your way back to your ship.

Description:While the Hands-On Diplomat gathers her things, you dispatch your bosun to the Presbyterate embassy. Then you set out yourself, leading your charge on a circuitous route. The embassy is hidden in London's sewers, and you are both sodden and reeking by the time you reach it. You find the door open, the offices empty. The cabinets have been plundered. Discarded documents are strewn across the floor.
<br/><br/>
The Hands-On Diplomat gives you a level look. She slides her pistol back into her satchel, disappointed. "A shame. Here: partial payment for a partial service." She hands you a misty bottle, then goes inside and locks the door. Back at your ship, an urchin waits with an envelope. Inside is a letter of gratitude. 'Thank you. Some of my countrymen are more concerned with the law's letter than its spirit. Enclosed is a token of my gratitude.' A second envelope is inside this one: a document of sensitive intelligence pilfered from the Presbyterate's files.

<br/><br/>
The Hands-On Diplomat gives you a level look. She slides her pistol back into her satchel with disappointment. "A shame. Here: partial payment for a partial serv-"
<br/><br/>
A gunshot echoes thunderously through the  tunnels! The Hands-On Diplomat falls into the muck, her fatal expression one of startlement. There is a tiny, splintered hole in the embassy door. Your Dapper Chap steps out from behind it.
<br/><br/>
"I do dislike fanatics," he frowns, dragging his would-be replacement inside. "Got your message. I thought about running, but I still have work to do. I thought a little stage-setting would drop her guard, though. Worked rather well, don't you think? Now. Come here." His smile is deep. His lips are warm.
