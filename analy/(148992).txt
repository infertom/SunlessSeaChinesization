Name:Further conversation with the acolyte
Id:148992
Description:The conversation is taking place in a corner of the building, on makeshift furniture fashioned out of emptied coffins. It feels strangely homey. 
<br/>
<br/>
"What about you?" she asks. "Is there any secret you struggle not to tell anyone?"



	ChildBranches1
Name:Say no, and mean it
Id:127754
Description:Your conscience is clear.

		DefaultEvent
Name:You shake your head
Id:148993
Description:You might have expected her to be disappointed that there's no story, but if anything she looks pleased. Perhaps she has enough dark pasts and sinister allusions around here.

	ChildBranches2
Name:Say no dishonestly
Id:127755
Description:There's nothing she needs to hear.

		DefaultEvent
Name:Secrets require lies
Id:148994
Description:You issue a simple denial. She frowns as though she doesn't believe you, but she doesn't challenge you either.
<br/>
<br/>
A gaunt man comes to take away the crates of dark pellets, and she gets up to speak with him. It's some time before she comes back to you.

	ChildBranches3
Name:Admit that you do have certain secrets
Id:127756
Description:Who doesn't?

		DefaultEvent
Name:A moment in silence
Id:148995
Description:The admission is harder than you might have expected. You don't go into detail, and she doesn't press you for further explanations.
<br/>
<br/>
"After all, if it's bad enough, I'll find out in the end," she says, her eyes glittering sideways at you through her goggles.

	ChildBranches4
Name:Tell the whole horrible truth
Id:127758
Description:Perhaps it will interest her.

		DefaultEvent
Name:Holding nothing back
Id:148997
Description:She listens politely as you relate the entire tale in all its gruesome detail. Shattered teeth and cooking tips and all.
<br/>
<br/>
"I've heard of such things before," she says at the end. "You're not the first and won't be the last."

	ChildBranches5
Name:Invent something pleasingly awful to tell her
Id:127767
Description:Who knows, perhaps she'll believe you.

		DefaultEvent
Name:A bit flat
Id:149010
Description:Your story starts out well: a sibling born under mysterious circumstances, the midwife going mad, your parents keeping you out of the baby's room. Laudanum bottles accumulating in the hallway. Specially commissioned rat-fashioned baby toys designed not to break under any amount of stress.
<br/>
<br/>
But at some point, perhaps during the portion about the tentacles, you lose the confidence of your listener.
<br/>
<br/>
The Austere Acolyte gives a little huff and turns away. "If you didn't want to tell me the truth, you could have just said so."

Name:One of your best
Id:149011
Description:You start with the thing in the cradle. Sucker marks left behind on your mother's arm. The midwife's disappearance. The ciphered message in the news the next day. What happened to your father's leg. The false story before the magistrate, and the bishop's intervention. The charitable funds collected under illegitimate pretenses.
<br/>
<br/>
The tale has everything: the sordid, the blasphemous, the biologically bizarre. 
<br/>
<br/>
The Acolyte listens to it with utter fascination. It is hard to tell whether she is convinced or merely spellbound by the power of your story, but for your purposes, either will do.
