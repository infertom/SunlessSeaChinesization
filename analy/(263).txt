Name:Accept his commission
Id:143692
Description:"Take it far away. We'll tell you where. You will be paid." [If you've already arranged with the Bright-Eyed Sequencer to take it to the Grand Geode, this will cause you to renege.]

		DefaultEvent
Name:"I'm grateful."
Id:176109
Description:"Here." He presses a crumpled note into your hand. "This is where you should take it. You'll learn something, I think. I had to seek the Masters' help for this - we will all be enmeshed in their plans - but it's worth it. I swear it's worth it."
<br/><br/>
He grips your arm, and is gone. You unfold the note.
