Description:"You're so beautiful," she tells you dreamily. "There are briars in your mouth." Her left eye pulses slowly. It's always difficult to know what she's actually seeing.

Name:An allegory of engines
Id:147863
Description:The Engineer has learnt a great deal about the powers and weaknesses of steel and fire and water. Once she must have been an extraordinary asset. But she can only express what she knows as poetry filtered through half-erotic visions. Roses and rivers and something like rain. It's quite pretty in its way, but it makes it challenging to understand what bit of the engine you need to bang on when the engine won't go.

Id:180636
Description:"The gallblighter wasp. You know it? Its children are in me." She smiles. "I can't be sorry. I can see such things..."
<br/><br/>
She tails off, hungrily watching your face. What is she seeing?
<br/><br/>
"Kingeater's Castle," she says at last, rather breathily. Her hand goes up to her throat. "I would like to see Kingeater's Castle through these eyes, before I go."
<br/><br/>
[Kingeater's Castle can be found in the far south-east of the Unterzee.]
