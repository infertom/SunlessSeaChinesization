Name:Board this empty mausoleum
Id:138397
Description:Superstitions of the zee give even cynical zailors pause before ransacking half-drowned vessels. Still, nothing in the code prohibits indulging curiosity.

Name:A harrowing emptiness
Id:167367
Description:The fate of the Nocturne is well known, and proven by the webs stretching across its battered hull. Aside from those and a few signs of struggle, the contents lie mostly undisturbed. After all, what use have the masters of Saviour's Rocks for trinkets, baubles, gold and gems?
<br /><br />
If the crew and passengers were lucky, they merely became lunch. If not... you've heard the stories; the kind of zee ztories saved for campfires on distant shores and cold nights when the rigging creaks. Of the Tree of Ages, a harbinger of doom crewed by sorrow-spiders. What happened to the lovers who found Storm's broken heart in a sandalwood box. The suicide songs of-

<br /><br />
A shout rises from the crew, their eyes locked in horror at a zailor caught slipping a jewelled trinket into his unmentionables. Before you can do anything, his crewmates have him by all the limbs, hurling him and his cursed plunder to join the Drownies in the black. None may steal from a half-drowned ship. There is no gold in the zee worth Salt's ire. Only sacrifice absolves.

Name:Light in the darkness
Id:167515
Description:It is true that the interior of the Nocturne is a dark, unwelcoming place that demands a candle for exploration. With the whole crew searching it thoroughly though, the wrecked ship will be a beacon to anyone... anything that might be passing.

Name:A harrowing emptiness
Id:167586
Description:The former crew and passengers of the Nocturne were taken by the sorrow-spiders to become part of the Tree of Seasons. You have freed them from that at least, though find little of interest in their abandoned belongings. To plunder the half-drowned ship could only bring down the wrath of Salt. It is best left well alone, as you sail away from this whole accursed mess.
