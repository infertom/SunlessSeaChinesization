Name:"I'm sorry. It's the pain. No, this is what you wanted, I think."
Id:148808
Description:He is eager to instruct you, like a drowning man striking for air. But he struggles to put words to his understanding. Does his sigil give him his insights? Or is it old learning he has failed to forget?.

Name:Invite him to dine with you
Id:127641
Description:He has an admirable appetite for so slight a fellow. 

		DefaultEvent
Name:Forgetfulness
Id:148811
Description:Seconds, then thirds, disappear in small, hasty morsels. He is nervous, and not a gifted conversationalist. You do your best to plug the silence. When you ask about his past, he winces. 
<br/><br/>
"I can't say, [q: Addressed As]. This -" he taps the livid sigil on his temple, which twitches like a scorpion's sting "- has burned away my memories. I recall I have a brother, but not his name or where he is. I remember the names of the ships I've served on - the <i>Implicit</i>, the <i>Bonny Swan</i> - but not their crew."
<br/><br/>
How did he come by the sigil? He clutches his head. "I don't know, I don't know. Thinking about it is like fire in my skull." He grits his teeth. "Someone must have hated me very much to curse me with it. But I can't even remember my enemy." [Speak to him again to advance his story.]

		DefaultEvent
Name:Parting ways
Id:182216
Description:He buries his face in his hands. "Even if I could remember, I would not want to. But it is only a matter of time until this -" he runs a finger over his sigil "- takes something I can't do without. Maybe I will forget how to breathe. Or which way is north. Perhaps I will strand us all at zee again, and it'll be oaths of silence and straws in the dark. Be rid of me, [q: Addressed As]. Put me ashore somewhere I can be forgotten."

		DefaultEvent
Name:He leans close
Id:182217
Description:He does not come on deck any more. He is light as a scarecrow; all hollow inside. A sudden pitch would cast him overboard. The blackness of his cabin is alleviated only by the sigil-glow, smugly violet. Since Kingeater's Castle he can feel the pull of the sea under his skin. He sees its changes like storms on the horizon. He can find a path by spilling blood in the waters and watching its churn. He tells you his secrets.

Id:147492

		DefaultEvent
Name:A destination
Id:182268
Description:He paces the deck. "I see a lonely house lit by tallow and wick. A bell is ringing. It rings now! Do you hear it?" He scratches at his sigil, which has begun to bleed. "Do you know this place, captain? Can I plot a course?"   
<br/><br/>
A place of candles and bells. The Chapel of Lights - a northern church where no sin is too terrible.

Name:The ship's surgeon finds you
Id:147496
Description:"He's awake, [q:Addressed As], and he's asking for you." The Navigator has slept - fitfully - since he collapsed on the Frostfound ice.

		DefaultEvent
Name:New purpose
Id:182273
Description:His sigil has grown. It reaches down to his cheek, now. The skin it marks is pitted and grey.
"Captain! The ice told me. The sigil's reflection was its opposite. Or inverse. It doesn't matter. We must go North! North and North and North. To the Avid Horizon. To Void's Approach." He struggles to rise. "Where are my charts? My compass? My sounding-line?"

Name:Suggest another option
Id:147498
Description:It would be a release for him - of a sort - and it has a certain sanguine poetry...

		DefaultEvent
Name:Your stomach growls
Id:182276
Description:You describe a rite that you could conduct at Kingeater's Castle. Afterwards, he would forget his pain. He would even forget that he forgot. The part of him that suffers will be gone, and whatever remains will serve you. He shudders. "It is not forgiveness," he whispers. "But perhaps it is justice."

Name:Ask where he would like to disembark
Id:147527
Description:"Leave me on Codex, where my silence won't be questioned. Or at the Empire of Hands, where no one will care."

		DefaultEvent
Name:Choices
Id:182317
Description:You have heard that the Mute Exiles on Codex reward anyone who brings them a new initiate. They pay with secrets of fire. 
<br/><br/>
There will be no such recompense from the apes of Port Stanton, but your Navigator offers to leave you his tools, charts and notebooks in return for his passage.
<br/>
[Abandon your Navigator at Codex to earn a valuable item, or at Port Stanton in the Empire of Hands for a lesser reward but an increase in your Mirrors. Or perhaps there is another, less pleasant option...]

Name:He stands at the rail, staring into the dark
Id:147637
Description:He flinches when you join him. His sigil has been troubling him of late.

		DefaultEvent
Name:The next step
Id:182484
Description:"I'm sorry, [q:Addressed As]. I was remembering the Chapel of Lights, and the priest's counsel. Frostfound, he said. You have been so kind - I hate to ask you for more, but..." His sigil dims. It coils like a poised serpent.
