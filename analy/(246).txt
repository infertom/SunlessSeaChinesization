Name:Ask bluntly about his hook
Id:126631
Description:...after a fish supper and a half-carafe of adequate Morelways.

		DefaultEvent
Name:A profession-changing injury
Id:147322
Description:"A snake bit it off." For once, he is not smiling. "I put my hand through an unwise mirror... and a snake bit it off. That ended my career in the theatre."
<br/><br/>
He leans forward. "I am not a spiteful man. But I lost my hand. Perhaps you can imagine what that means to a magician. I am looking for revenge, [q:Addressed As]. I need weapons against the serpent. I rather hope we might come across them. I may ask a favour of you, if we do."

Name:Ask how a magician came to be an engineer
Id:126683
Description:...after a meal of salt pork and a glass of good Greyfields.

		DefaultEvent
Name:A drained glass
Id:147398
Description:He gestures (carefully) with his hook. "This. It makes card-tricks difficult. But we know about mechanisms, we magicians. My speciality was mirrors, but there are principles in common. It was a good start. And I found that I needed to go to sea." Why?
<br/><br/>
"Because, [q:Addressed As], someone owes me a hand. Once a friend: now an enemy. I am looking for a weapon to use against them. If once we find it, I may have a favour to ask you."

Name:Dispel the darkness?
Id:126684
Description:He's mentioned before that he was in the theatre. Could he arrange a... diversion... to improve morale? His eyes are opaque. "Yes," he acknowledges. "But I will require some very particular materials. Don't ask why."

		DefaultEvent
Name:An event on the afterdeck
Id:147399
Description:The crew gathers before a backdrop of parabola-linen marked with stars and eyes. Their mood is jocular, sceptical, but anticipatory. They could use a show.
<br/><br/>
The Magician appears. His eyes are mirrors. (Lenses, no doubt!) He has four arms, like an Indian god. (Surrogates, like his hook, surely.) He exhales blue fire! (Alcohol vapour, probably.) He raises his arms, and the air is filled with golden petals. (Up his sleeve!) Vines leap from the deck, twine his legs, creep up past his waist. (Did he release narcotic vapours?) The air is filled with viric light, and the Neath-roof above trembles, seems to open to a sky with an orange sun. Long grasses rise around you. (Er...)
<br/><br/>
It's as if you wander in a meadow. Here and there your crew stand, chatting, laughing, eating fallen fruits. Rich juice runs down their chins. The sun is warm. Walls of jungle rise around you. Beneath your feet, the dark earth churns like the sea, and in the shadows of the undergrowth, serpents hiss like steam - but here, for a while, you are safe. Until you wake.
<br/><br/>
You wake. You are in your bunk: the ship is quiet around you, bar the throbbing of the engines that the Magician tends. The watch-bell rings, and you hear crew rouse from their hammocks. You can still smell hot earth, dark fruit.

Name:Ask again about the Khanate
Id:129686
Description:He needs to find help in the Khanate to enact his revenge. What kind of help? Invite him to dinner and ask about it.

		DefaultEvent
Name:"Foolish help."
Id:152142
Description:"London isn't the first city that's been brought down here. The Khaganians came down on the last one. Their ancestors, I mean. They fell into the service of the kings behind mirrors. The sensible ones thought better of it, and made a sensible exit, to found the New Khanate on the Salt Steppes. Nothing remains of the others. A lesson in the dangers of meddling with Fingerkings. As is this." He taps his hook.
<br/><br/>
"But meddling will out: it always does. Some of the Khaganians are still silly enough to preserve the arts of their ancestors. It's the silly ones I hope to find."

Description:Offer the Magician a Mirrorcatch Box Full of Very Angry Dream-Snakes.

		DefaultEvent
Name:"....no."
Id:181080
Description:"No use to me. They're not royalty." Perhaps that's why he's in such a tearing hurry to leave the room. But perhaps you've properly disturbed his composure.

Name:Proposition the Genial Magician
Id:147267
Description:"Honestly, I could use the distraction. Don't look at me like that. You're terribly desirable. But I <i>could</i> use the distraction." [The Magician enjoys erudition. Ensure that your Pages is at least twenty points higher than your Iron.]

		DefaultEvent
Name:A certain reserve
Id:181942
Description:The Magician is both accomplished and inventive. You do detect a certain reserve; and for your part, there is always the delicate menace of the hook. But you exhaust each other delightfully, and the watch-bell comes only too soon.

		DefaultEvent
Name:Diminished
Id:181943

		DefaultEvent
Name:Thrill granting
Id:181944
Description:The Magician is both accomplished and inventive. He abandons himself entirely to the encounter, and, for a little while, the zee and its terrors are quite forgotten. You can never, however, quite forget the hook: but it lends a frisson all of its own. He urges you to ignore the watch-bell when it tolls. But you are the captain, after all.<br/><br/>

		DefaultEvent
Name:A sinuous embrace
Id:181945
Description:A piercing hour of pleasure ensues. The Magician is both subtle and remorseless. At times, his flexibility borders on the boneless: although he remains firm in all the right places.
<br/><br/>
"How did I ever do without you?" he hisses passionately. You're not completely certain that he's talking to you.
