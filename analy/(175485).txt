Description:Soul-hungry monkeys reluctantly tend this trading post, waiting for an opportunity to escape. Bloated fleas hop from ape to man and man to ape, gorging themselves without a care for which is which.

		DefaultEvent
Name:The locals call this Shell Beach
Id:175497
Description:It is a place of death, where the bones and still-rotting carcasses of man and ape alike are left to the thirst of the zee. The charnel history of the Empire of Hands stretches out amongst the flies and the maggots; of the apes who would be men and their stolen civilisation.
<br /><br />
Something glints. Around the neck of a skeleton, a locket. You pocket it, though it does not look like it is worth much. The zee infamously takes much. Sometimes though, it gives back. Perhaps this will prove to be such a time for some hopeful soul out there.

		DefaultEvent
Name:King of an empty castle
Id:175593
Description:The Flea-Ridden Mayor scratches himself on a chair made of crates, surrounded by boxes of long-rotten trade goods. As a five-souled ape, he would be able to petition for membership of Court. For now, the trade embargo has left him trapped on the outside; a three-souled overseer with no talent for order.

		DefaultEvent
Name:The king of Port Stanton
Id:175594
Description:"Ah, my dearest human..." trills the Esteemed Mayor, relaxing as a concubine picks the nits from his hair. She presents the latest to him, but he graciously gives her permission to eat it herself. Such is the generosity of a five-souled monkey.

Name:Buried treasure... being buried?
Id:178033
Description:Deep in the forest, an important looking ape in yellow robes oversees two lesser monkeys as they dig a hole in the ground. Having dropped a strange looking idol into the pit and covered it up, one scrapes a deep X over it, while the other slides a map into a bottle, corks it, and scampers off to throw it into the zee.
<br /><br />
Curious. However, any treasure hunter who may find the map and follow it here will be out of luck.

Id:178034
Description:With the help of a few crewmembers, you gather several crates of fruits and berries from the thick jungle. In exchange for a share, the monkeys of Port Stanton are oddly happy to help you sift through and find the best. Much of the crew subsequently suffers from terrible diarrhoea. The two things are, perhaps, unrelated.

Name:A hunting party!
Id:178035
Description:Monkey soldiers scour the jungle for fresh meat. The Empire has little of it, but the unsouled monkeys are considered fair prey by their civilised, ensouled betters. So to are any humans who might disappear without too much trouble. Once back at court, both will be served up and heralded the finest venison, veal, chicken and pork for a Court that knows what it is supposed to like... but not what it actually <i>tastes</i> like.
<br /><br />
You hide in the bushes until the hunting party has gone, and slip away undetected in the other direction.

Description:An ambush! The twisting paths of the jungle have led far from port, into a dark claustrophobia of trees and mushrooms. The party of savage one-soul apes backs you into a corner, its leader sniffing you with an avaricious hunger. Is it the smell that tells it that you have no soul for them today? Or something else?
<br /><br />
The ways of the Pentecost apes are mysterious, and this one feels no need to share them. It simply hisses in your face before bidding its minions follow it away.

		DefaultEvent
Name:Goodbye
Id:182214
Description:There is no perceivable difference in him following the sale of his soul. The proceeds furnish him with a tiny, anonymous shack and a modest store of gewgaws to sell to traders who call at the creaking jetty. He shakes your hand at his door. "Thank you for your indulgence, [q:Addressed As]. You will find my equipment and charts in my cabin. I hope they lead you on happier journeys."

He rubs at the sigil that now sprawls across the right side of his face, forgets what he was about to say, and goes inside. You do not see him again.

		DefaultEvent
Name:Words on the wind
Id:183582
Description:The barely-souled monkeys of Port Stanton mutter together in a dozen bastardised dialects: invented stories, gossip twenty years old, intimate revelations from the scraps of subconscious knowledge that adhere to souls. The effect is of sampling a rich, fascinating stew that might just possibly contain rat-droppings. The Admiral would regard this mission as a failure, but others might be interested.
