Id:157600
Description:"Medicines; practices; techniques; knowledge. I'm at zee to learn. It's not as if - I don't mean to be discourteous, but you don't pay well. Not compared to the Empress."
<br/><br/>
"To learn, then. And there is a particular urgency - " but here she checks herself. It's unusual to see her discomposed, but she is. She searches for words, reconsiders what she has to say, and leaves shortly thereafter. But she smiles and claps you on the shoulder as she passes.

<br/><br/>
"No - there is little more I can say. I promised you I would keep no more of my own secrets, but I am another, now. No, this is not some narrow sleight. This is a holy mystery I would not curse you with. But you have my thanks, always. Always and forever!"

Name:Wine!
Id:159495
Description:You and the Campaigner toast her rebirth. ("Not a rebirth," she corrects you. "Perhaps a pre-death. Hush. Don't look at me like that. I am a realist. Have another glass of wine.") She has survived; she has found a cure. ("If anyone could," she points out, "it would be me, after all. You're lucky it was me who fell ill.") Her wisdom has been tested, tempered, and not found wanting. ("Well, quite. But you were an invaluable assistant. A fine vintage, this. Another glash?") You and she are safe: and all shall be well, and all manner of thing shall be well. ("Your very fine health!")
