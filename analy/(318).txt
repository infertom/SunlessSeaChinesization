Id:181372

Name:At the surface
Id:181373
Description:The Dead Letter Office is still here, its machine still working, its baskets still filling with missed invitations and misplaced wills. Shouldn't it have been blasted away, destroyed by the force of what lies beneath?

Description:The rest of the spiral will still be there after you've got your breath.

Name:Visions? Dreams?
Id:181416
Description:You relax against a shelf. It isn't comfortable at all, as the edge of a metal box is prodding you between the spine and the shoulder blade, and somewhere off to your right is a sound like hoarse breathing. It doesn't matter.
<br/><br/>
In the dimness you see, or remember, or dream, a silver tree growing in a courtyard. The reverie lasts only a few heartbeats before you're properly awake again.
