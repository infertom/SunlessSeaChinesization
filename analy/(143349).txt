Name:Iron Republic
Id:143349
Description:Factory-engines roar like false lions. Blood thunders in the dock-pipes. Crimson lightning skitters across the deck, leaps to the rail, curls there like a cat. The city is reflected in glassy-calm harbour water: the citizens there have the heads of dogs and serpents.
<br/><br/>
Hell has brought freedom to the Iron Republic: freedom from all laws, even those of nature.

<br/><br/>
When they're done, the Egg lies in shards, and the Seal looks little different, but there is a watchfulness about it. The Artificer shakes the Cannoneer's hand. "I've missed working with you," she says. "I've missed it so much."
<br/><br/>
The Cannoneer grins that grin. "Nearly done! We can mount it on the bridge, if you like. But we'll need a housing if we want to use it further. It'll have to be heartmetal. I knew a man, long ago... but I hear he went to Station III. (Swam there, the story says.) If you can get us the run of Station III, I can get you in to see him."

"No, I don't know where Station III is. It's a secret."

		DefaultEvent
Name:Fungal horror
Id:181956
Description:The blemmigan spins boldly down the gang-plank. It seems startled when it meets itself on the quay, twice. Its duplicates bob solicitously, like ambassadors greeting their peers, and continue past it, up into your ship. The first blemmigan vanishes into the crowd. The other two peer up at you as if to say: are we <i>quite</i> finished here?
