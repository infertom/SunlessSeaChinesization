Id:143010

Name:What do maids eat?
Id:143014
Description:The diet of domestic servants is a mystery to you. Of traumatised, ceiling-clinging maids who may not even be human, still less so. You offer her milk, bread, wine, ship's biscuits. She shakes her head and cries like a wounded fox.

Name:Down she comes
Id:149703
Description:
You try to question her. "Those poor zailors!" she spits. You realise that in all the time you spent at Hunter's Keep, she had never spoken. "The poor zailors! I didn't come here for this! Damn them to the well!"
<br/><br/>
She's finished the meat. She returns to the ceiling in a single inhuman bound.

Name:Remarkable agility!
Id:143011
Description:She runs round the ceiling like a squirrel - drops to hiss and claw at one of your zailors - retreats into the scullery - slithers through the window there and returns through the chimney, black with soot. You glare at each other, panting.

Name:Hauled down
Id:149704
Description:It's like trying to get a jaguar out of a tree. Three of your crew are badly bitten, but at last you restrain her and she lies on the table, glaring and growling. What now?

You try to question her. "Those poor zailors!" she spits. You realise that in all the time you spent at Hunter's Keep, she had never spoken. "The poor zailors! I didn't come here for this! Damn them to the well!"
<br/><br/>
With a serpentine wriggle, she's free of the net. She returns to the ceiling in one inhuman leap.
