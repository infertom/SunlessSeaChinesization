Name:The Web of Stone
Id:167215
Description:The last remnants of an ancient citadel, now home to the spider-council of Saviour's Rocks. Eyeless Weavers and Widows busy themselves tending to the spiders and their Tree of Seasons, showing neither interest or concern at your presence. You will be Summoned.

Name:Spy on the Weavers and Widows
Id:138295
Description:To spy on the blind is no challenge, but the glares of the sorrow-spiders all around make it clear that while here, you will never not be under observation.

		DefaultEvent
Name:A family of red and green
Id:167216
Description:The cultists politely ignore you as you watch them at work; the Weavers in red, tending the webs, the Widows in green, caring for their masters by reducing grisly foodstuffs to paste and feeding the more senior members of the spider-council by hand.
<br /><br />
If there is any reason for these assignments, it is impossible to tell. Certainly, there is an assortment of male Widows and female Weavers amongst the cultists' ranks.Perhaps the sorrow-spiders have as much interest in human gender as in spider-gender.

Name:Summoned by the spider-council
Id:138353
Description:It is time. You have been called.

		DefaultEvent
Name:The Tree of Seasons runs black with sorrow
Id:167301
Description:From the eyes of the statue pours a poisonous conclave, a thousand lesser sorrow-spiders perching on every rock, brick and outcropping. The Emissary of Spiders rises from his meditation at the base, his robe festooned with the most senior members of the council that they might whisper their will in his ear. They speak, of course. Most eloquently, in fact. That does not mean they will lower themselves to speak to you. Not directly.
<br /><br />
"Excellent. Excellent." The Emissary of Spiders bows slightly. "My mephitic masters bid you welcome. I believe we have business to discuss."

Name:Behold the Tree of Seasons
Id:138361
Description:The heart of the spider-council. Few have laid eyes upon it, and most of those have had said eyes ritually removed to birth new sorrow-spiders shortly afterwards.

		DefaultEvent
Name:Pride of the sorrow-spiders
Id:167313
Description:Branches of webs hang in their thousands from the colossal statue of some being as far from an angel as an angel from a man. The spider-council has made its home in the chipped out eyes, surrounded by its lessers and a precious collection of ensnared unfortunates. Hundreds of these captives dangle in silk cocoons, the sane and still-living tended to just enough to serve their full measure of both use and suffering.

Name:Burn the Tree of Seasons
Id:138362
Description:The Weavers and Widows have torches to warm them during their work. Now you will use them to put an end to it! D__n the consequences!

		DefaultEvent
Name:Time slows to a crystal moment
Id:167314
Description:Wait. Are you making a terrible mistake?

Name:Attempt to rest until summoned
Id:138376
Description:Amongst an army of poisonous spiders and deranged cultists? Still not as rough as the flophouses of Spite.

		DefaultEvent
Name:An uneasy rest
Id:167331
Description:There is little to be had. Every time you close your eyes for more than a moment, you feel the hairs of a sorrow-spider on your skin or an exploratory rub of a mandible against your eyes. But time slowly passes even so, and eventually, time is what it is.

Name:Hospitality of the sorrow-spiders
Id:138377
Description:A polite Widow indicates her fellow disciples' willingness for you to take a meal with them.

		DefaultEvent
Name:A feast of gods
Id:167332
Description:The sorrow-spiders often resort to cannibalism when food is low. It is on occasion the Weavers and Widows' privilege to share that bounty, that they may be a greater part of the whole. At least the poison has been removed, and the legs are surprisingly effective when pressed into duty as impromptu toothpicks.

		RareDefaultEvent
Name:"Where is the horse that pulled our cart?"
Id:167336
Description:This is one of many questions for which an answer can serve no good. The meat is not especially tender, but it is at least filling.



	ChildBranches7
Name:A new initiate
Id:138452
Description:A naked young man lies on a stone platform, his shaking hands squeezed tight by his brothers and sisters to be.

		DefaultEvent
Name:An eye for an I, said the spider to the fly
Id:167447
Description:There is no chanting and no singing. There is just a low-pitched noise from the cultists' throats as a sorrow-spider climbs up the initiate's body. He quivers as it reaches his face, drips of excited poison dripping into his lips. Strong, caring, but above all else, firm fingers peel back his eyelids and hold them wide.
<br /><br />
A scream. A mouth silenced with bundled cloth. An embrace. A note raised high and loud, until the Tree of Seasons itself seems to shake in the cacophony.
<br /><br />
A Widow gently kisses his new brother on the forehead, wrapping a silk blindfold around his hollow eyes.

Name:Further investigate the Tree of Seasons
Id:138939
Description:The sorrow-spiders have taken many prisoners.

		DefaultEvent
Name:There is no escape but death
Id:168334
Description:The captives have long since ceased moaning, though some still quiver as sorrow-spiders crawl across their bodies, milking their secrets. A Venturing Cartographer who travelled too far east. A Lady of Means, from a voyage eighteen years prior. The Captain of the wrecked ship Nocturne. A broken Devil, old enough to have forgotten the smell of brimstone. Their eyes long since harvested to birth the sorrow-spiders' progeny, they hang immobile in darkness, dreaming of oblivion.

Name:"Before the harvest, an orchard must grow."
Id:167697
Description:They speak of a chaos brought under control by a spider-council formed from the blinded eye of a great zee-beast. They speak of the strained partnership it maintains with those who could so easily be enslaved. They speak of a Tree of Epochs, to be birthed in forbidden light, its branches stretching through the Neath to become the perfect geometry of sorrow.

		SuccessEvent
Name:"A secret shared is no secret at all."
Id:167699
Description:They speak of a century of stolen secrets, and a almost as long regretted promise made to a great zee-beast. They speak of its greed for knowledge, for which it willingly blinded another creature with the light of the stars. They speak of secrets, eagerly grasped, reluctantly relinquished. They speak of the curse of curiosity. In hushed tones, they speak of a trap, yet to be baited.

Id:167702
Description:They speak of a ship sent forth from Saviour's Rocks to catch secrets in its webs. They speak of its triumph, stealing a star-blinded eye of the deep. They speak of a greater eye still; unseen, unseeing, finally attainable.

Name:"But what is it that truly births the masters of sorrow? A thing of the jelly... or the soul?"
Id:167705
Description:They speak of the secret origins of councils; of apples blinded by Correspondence becoming cores. They speak of the grand council that is, and the greater council that is to come; the Tree of Epochs that will turn joy into sorrow and from that sorrow hatch eschaton.
