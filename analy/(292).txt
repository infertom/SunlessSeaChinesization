Description:Your Mog's fearless agility gives it a tremendous advantage. It leaps from pirate to pinnacle to pirate, leaving a trail of swiped eyes, bleeding scalps and multi-lingual curses. In confusion and terror, the enemy flees! ...but when the dust clears, the Mog, too, is nowhere to be found. Did it lose its footing? Or did it just decide the Mourn is more to its liking?
