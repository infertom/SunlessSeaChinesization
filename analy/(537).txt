Name:Exploring the Shattered Citadel
Id:155227
Description:All the Neath is dark. The Citadel is dark as only a once-bright place can be. It hung up there among the false-stars, drowned in azure light, for... how long? Now it's here. So are you. [Very bad things will happen if you run out of candles.]
