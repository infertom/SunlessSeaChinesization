		DefaultEvent
Name:Too bright
Id:155239
Description:Its eye rises like the moon. You look on it, unflinching, as long as you can. Its gaze strips you of every defence - your pride, your courage, your skin, your flesh. When its gaze falls on your naked bones, the terror wakes you screaming.

Your crew watch you warily. They are beginning to lose faith in you.
[You have failed to defeat your Nightmare. It has grown in strength.]

Name:Something above
Id:155241
Description:You dive cleanly into the water! It is scalding hot: your skin peels away like old paper. Beneath you the Eye rises. Your descent will take you directly into its dark, impossible pupil. Your lungs are bursting. You will wake, die, or both. The Eye opens all the way, and in its glistening centre you see the reflection of the God that lives in the roof: a lost lorn angry thing of lightnings, a lone exile -
<br/><br/>
You wake. You have passed through the Nightmare and out the other side.
