Name:The Fallen City of Varchas
Id:152353
Description:The walled city of Varchas is dark. The glowing fungus has been stripped from the Five Towers, and the Principal Mirrors are all smashed to pieces.
<br/><br/>
The Mirrored Gates are broken into tiny facets and each one glints malevolently. You can see... shapes... moving in them. Glimmers of cosmogone - that burnt orange darkness. Glimpses of smoking sea. Sweet laughter that hitches and skitters like the death of clocks.
