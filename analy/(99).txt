Description:The Calendar Council, they say, dislikes light. Shops prefer to conduct their business without lamps, or they might find their windows broken and wares confiscated. Parliament still sits, but they do so in lampless hush. The Admiralty has locked its doors: the Navy, what's left of it, has gone to ground.
