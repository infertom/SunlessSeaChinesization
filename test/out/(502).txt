Name: The Burning White Light of Varchas
Id: 146641
Description: The walled city of Varchas is a tangle of green vines and luminescent fungal flowers slow-blooming around mouldering stone. A quincunx of carved stepped-towers rise over the walls and pour burning white light into the bleak sky. 
<br/><br/>
A rough, shadowed path leads from the docks to the Mirrored Gates of Varchas. Two towering carved-stone lamps throw their light on the angled mirrors, and a blue-cloaked Guard stands in the reflected pool of light. 
<br/><br/>
The city is a beacon against the tree-hushed, sprawling darkness of the Elder Continent. In the far distance a vast mountain glimmers.

Name: Choke on the smell
Id: 126187
Description: It is overpowering, sweet. It comes from the fungus growing wild all over the city's stones. 

		DefaultEvent
Name: 
Id: 146642
Description: The flowers have white-waxy leaves which leave powdery traces on your fingers. The light coming from the city has the same camphorous quality. And the smell: perfume worn too many days on the body; unread books left to turn to ink-stained pulp, a garden drowned and rotting in still water.

Name: The zailors wave you over
Id: 129707
Description: They are sitting on some upturned crates on the docks, playing a game with mirrored chips and stylised snakes made of bone. 

		DefaultEvent
Name: 
Id: 152169
Description: “You're not thinking of going <i>in there</i>?” The zailors gawk at you in in unconcealed horror.
<br/><br/>
They take turns telling you gruesome stories of Varchas which they no doubt invented whole-cloth. Some are convinced that the Varchaasi render zailors into tallow to light their city; others say they steal shadows and sell them to their masters. All of them are convinced that they blind any strangers who dare to gaze too long upon their city's secrets.
<br/><br/>
“We're just waiting to be paid, and then we're off,” one of the zailors says, nervously fingering a mirror-chip. “I've only got one eye left, and I'd like to keep it.”

Id: 129708

Id: 152173
Description: She makes a mark in her ledger before ringing a brass bell. The mirrors of the gates rearrange to give you space to pass, but never once allow shadow to touch the Guard.

“Our ways are not yours, Taamas. Remember that, and walk in the light of Mihir.”
