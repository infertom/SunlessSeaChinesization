Name: The First Curator's Manse
Id: 157004
Description: “No more light,” the Obsequious Steward cautions you. "The Curator is terribly afraid of moths." He opens the door, and you step into near-darkness. A pair of luminous lamp-lighter bees buzz in a latticed ivory tube. There is no other source of light.
<br/><br/>
 A bandaged shape no larger than a child lies crumpled on a couch. It lifts its head with obvious effort. It takes several seconds for you to distinguish its voice from the soft buzz of the bees.

Name: Accept the commission
Id: 132783
Description: "Thank you. This poor flesh... thirsts for colours..."

		DefaultEvent
Name: No more words
Id: 157010
Description: It collapses, rustling, back on to the couch. Even the effort of speaking seems to have diminished it a little. The audience is over. As the door opens, it shrinks from the finger of light that reaches across the floor.
<br/><br/>
Outside, the Obsequious Steward nods. "The book? Yes, the book." He hands you a slim, illustrated volume. "The Curator is old - old as dust. We will all be grateful if you do it this one last favour."

Description: "Oh... bright as... bright as waking..."

		DefaultEvent
Name: Cage-frail fingers
Id: 157975
Description: The Curator cups its hands over the lump of glowing coral. Its face, you see now, is masked with copper. Its fingers wither in the light. A curl of smoke rises. But It only clutches the coral tighter. "The sea," it whispers. "I smell the sea."
<br/><br/>
<i>You</i> smell scorched dust. But here's your payment, in rubies of antique cut. The Curator seems happy.

Id: 133353
Description: "I smell - stars..."

		DefaultEvent
Name: A cavity
Id: 157976
Description: Beside the Curator's couch waits a humped machine of iron and brass. "There," it wheezes, straining to raise its arm. A recess, approximately the size of the cinder, waits.
<br/><br/>
You place the cinder there and close the lid. Faint atonal music, like the pricking of starlight, drifts from within. "I will never see Parabola," the Curator wheezes. "But perhaps you will. Take this mirror. It was born in a volcano..." Dark glass, serpent-carved.

Id: 133355
Description: "Yes. I want to forget..."

		DefaultEvent
Name: A waiting pedestal
Id: 157978
Description: At its direction, you place the skull atop a dripstone pedestal - a stalagmite, once, now carved with crockets and grimacing faces. Irrigo sparks crawl across it. For a moment you forget what you were doing.
<br/><br/>
"Thank you," the Curator whispers. "Perhaps you have saved me from the Sanatorium. And perhaps - the emergence - will be less painful -" Its chest pulses feebly. 
<br/><br/>
You accept a single huge black pearl. The Curator's fancies grow worse, but it pays well.

		DefaultEvent
Name: The driest of chuckles
Id: 157979
Description: "My left eye is blind. Should I replace it with this one, it will be no blinder. But perhaps I will see - within - " It raises the hand with the Hunter's Eye towards its concealed face.
<br/><br/>
No sound is indescribable, but some should be. This is one. Let us not trouble ourselves with its nuances - its reminders of marsh and gangrene and chrysalid emergence.
<br/><br/>
"Take," it says. Its voice is ragged. It gestures at a side-table where a spoire-tusk sits. A pearl tiara is perched jauntily atop the tusk. Both, apparently, are yours.

Description: "We would have made a better contract. But we hungered for the flesh of gods."

		DefaultEvent
Name: A stained finger
Id: 157980
Description: It extends a brittle arm from beneath its coverlet - dips it in the ink - conveys the finger back to its hidden mouth.
<br/><br/>
"Ah," it sighs. "The colour will enter my bones. And then, perhaps, the Moth." 
<br/><br/>
It's plainly rambling, but at least it hasn't forgotten your reward - a cameo of a bandaged beauty painted on the mummified palm of a mummified hand. All right, not to everyone's taste, but it's terribly well executed.

Description: "This is the border of Parabola. The dream-country. You know that, don't you? Yes. The devils know that, too..."
<br/><br/>
It becomes motionless - for so long that you wonder if it is finally truly dead. At last it expels a rattling breath and points wordlessly at a cloisonné mask on a trophy-stand, half-visible in the gloom. "Elder Continent," it wheezes. "Made within sight of the Mountain. Wear it and think... of me..."

Id: 133622

		DefaultEvent
Name: A birth
Id: 158396
Description: The Curator moves faster than you've ever seen - flinging its arms back, as if in delight. Its chest pulses, then crumbles inwards. It cries out softly, and turns its masked face to watch you. Its chest crumbles like damp clay. Something damp and sleekly shining pushes out. Antennae rustle. Faceted eyes glisten.
<br/><br/>
The Curator's hand reaches up to caress the creature, and then goes still forever. It frees itself, flexing damp wings. A moth of prodigious size. Its wings are figured with patterns in familiar colours - peligin, viric, irrigo...

		DefaultEvent
Name: A waiting pedestal
Id: 159154
Description: At its direction, you place the Core in a bath of frothing acid. It dissolves slowly. Irrigo vapours ascend, and snake into your mouth, eyes, heart. For a long minute, you forget who you are. When you return to yourself, no trace of the Fluke remains.
<br/><br/>
"Thank you," the Curator whispers. "Perhaps you have saved me from the Sanatorium. And perhaps - the emergence - will be less painful -" Its chest pulses feebly.

Description: The Curator cups its hands over the soft-glowing chess-piece. Its face, you see now, is masked with copper. Its fingers wither in the light. A curl of smoke rises. But It only clutches the chess-piece tighter. "The sea," it whispers. "I smell the sea."
