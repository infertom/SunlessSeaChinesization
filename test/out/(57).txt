Description: Your search upends empty casks and sea-chests, alarms the mascot, enrages the innocent cook. The crew know what you seek, but none will name it. The fog of fear thickens.

Name: A cannibal among us
Id: 144491
Description: You find the culprit in a cubby-hole in the aft hold, concealed by a blanket. There are corpse-candles, crude images, and a pot of appalling soup. A human shin-bone has been half-carved into a flute. "A reckoning!" the cannibal cackles as he's dragged off to the brig. " A reckoning is not to be postponed!"

You hold a hasty ship-court and sentence him to the only conceivable penalty: binding and drowning. He's still laughing as he goes under.
