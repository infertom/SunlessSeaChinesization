Name: Geometer's House
Id: 168891
Description: Now you have been invited to his home, at the time customarily appointed for him to receive those who are not his equal in rank, yet not so far beneath him as to deserve to be ignored. What ceremonial gift will you bring?

Name: Bring a string of rats
Id: 139258
Description: Cobras like to eat rodents, surely?

		DefaultEvent
Name: For the cat
Id: 168892
Description: The rats are accepted but immediately passed on to the household cat - a sleek black satisfied creature, in its own small mask of filigree gold. 
<br/><br/>
Awkwardly, this leaves you with no other gift for the Geometer himself. You have no choice to depart early, before someone thinks to have you re-masked in a more embarrassing part.

Name: Bring a necklet of lapis beads
Id: 139259
Description: If they do not suit him, they may suit a wife of his; if they don't suit her, he can use them for an offering.

		DefaultEvent
Name: Feeling blue
Id: 168893
Description: He gives them to a servant with orders that they be crushed, and the powder made to pigment, and the pigment used for painting. It is uncertain whether this is a deadly insult.

<br/><br/>
You aren't thrown out of the house, at any rate.

Name: Bring a poem concerning snakes, copied on a new scroll
Id: 139260
Description: 800 lines on the scaly denizens of the snake pit.

		DefaultEvent
Name: Mixed results
Id: 168894
Description: He appears to be pleased by this gift, but it takes him aback, as well. Several times he remarks that this sort of merchandise is something he would expect to be brought to the island by a Bat.
<br/><br/>
It requires a great deal of chittering and wing-folding to persuade him of your Moth nature.

Name: Bring a comb made of bone
Id: 139261
Description: Perhaps he grows hair beneath his mask, which covers his whole head.



		DefaultEvent
Name: ...no.
Id: 168895
Description: Flung away into a corner! Broken! He is disdainful. What use for a comb to a man whose head is covered in bare scales day in and out? 
<br/><br/>
From a joker, for instance baboon mask, it would have been a very good witticism, but from you, no! Wholly out of place!

Name: Bring fresh candles
Id: 139263
Description: You have heard that he likes candles.



		DefaultEvent
Name: Hunger set aside
Id: 168898
Description: The gift is suited to him personally: one can see this by the way that he hesitates regretfully before he performs the rejection that etiquette requires. It was thoughtful, but it is not the gift of Moth to Cobra. Therefore, wrong.

Name: Bring two honey cakes
Id: 139264
Description: Isn't that the proper gift for lulling snakes? 



		DefaultEvent
Name: Triumph
Id: 168899
Description: He accepts; he approves. The cakes are placed on the front table of his receiving room so that the other guests may observe and appreciate the correctness of your gesture. 
<br/><br/>

You are permitted to stand to one side and to watch the others arrive, but there is no one whose gift supplants yours in the place of honor. Not even the gift of a preserved lark, frozen in gelatin with a bubble of song rising from its open beak.
<br/><br/>

When you depart the Chief Geometer's house, he presses on you a prediction: that one day when you have most need, the earth will swallow you in one place and spit you out in another. It is, of course, only a ritual saying.

Name: Bring nothing
Id: 139265
Description: It is impertinent for one of lesser rank to presume to show charity to a superior.



		DefaultEvent
Name: No.
Id: 168900
Description: You arrive empty-handed. Already piled on his table are the wrappings of other gifts. They reprove you. You have erred. You have no choice to depart early, before someone thinks to have you re-masked in a more embarrassing part.

Name: Do not go
Id: 139267
Description: It is necessary for him to offer but incorrect for you to accept.

		DefaultEvent
Name: Nothing lost but nothing gained
Id: 168902
Description: You sit at home, in a quake. When he sends a message to reprove you for your non-attendance, is this also part of the dance?
