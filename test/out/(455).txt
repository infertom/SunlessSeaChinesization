Name: A vile hive
Id: 148717
Description: When you come in sight of the cottage, you think for a moment that it's been overgrown with glistening black ivy. A few more steps, and you notice the ivy is shifting in the wind: before you realise that, as is generally the case in the Neath, there is no wind to speak of.
<br/><br/>
The 'ivy' heaves like the sea, and the closest portion suddenly lifts and dissolves. The air is filled with a deep and savage buzzing. A cloud of great black bees rises above the cottage: extends a limb in your direction. You back away. You do not run.

Name: Wake in fright
Id: 148699
Description: You scramble up the stones. The ground is warm. You grow tired before you are more than half-way up your mouth is full of ashes. There is a sound in the earth - a profound, complex, overwhelming drone, like the buzzing of a billion billion bees. You bend your head a little closer...and that's all you remember.

<br/><br/>
When you wake, you're in the Deviless' cottage. Your head is in her lap. "I found you on the slopes," she says. "I thought I'd better bring you in before you heard anything you shouldn't." She smiles. "Strictly speaking, I should burn your ears off. But it's so nice to see you."

<br/><br/>
you bend your head closer. Closer. You feel the sounds tingling in your teeth and bones now. You can make out words: <i>Judgements. Dream. Zalt. Alliance. Ecstacy.</i> The sound overcomes you, and your vision blurs to red and grey.
