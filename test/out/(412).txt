Name: Gaider's Mourn
Id: 143340
Description: The Mourn is a stalagmite vast as a crag, and its foot has no safe harbours. The corsair's citadel nestles halfway up. An intricate system of winches takes the strain... and your ship rises slowly from the zee. Her hull creaks in protest. Grizzled zailors groan and cling to stanchions.
<br/><br/>
Higher, higher. Now the Unterzee shimmers like glass below. Children clambering in crevices cheer and wave alarmingly. The winch-motor slows, and you hang in a cradle next to a red-bowed pirate cutter.

Name: Explore the Mourn
Id: 124068
Description: There's a surprising quantity of actual landscape on the Mourn. It's vertical, admittedly, but once you find the beast-paths and urchin-roads, you can traverse it as you would a rocky moor, with an additional throatful of lurching terror.

Name: Another afternoon at the Arrant Limpet
Id: 127964
Description: A drinking-den by the dock-cradles is a good place for your crew to find companionship and let off steam... but although Gaider's Mourn is a free port, the corsairs prefer their own, and look askance at 'respectable' Londoners.

		DefaultEvent
Name: Cold shoulders at the Arrant Limpet

Description: "Ye're a generous soul. Ye'll have yer reward the other side of the River, one day. And here's a little reward for now. Good zailing to ye!"

The report is barely legible. Perhaps that's part of the code. The Admiralty will know.

Id: 165947
Description: At the winch-head, a deferential fellow in fustian waits. He bows to the Shady Sort. "A pleasure, as ever."
<br/><br/>
You, he barely favours with a glance. He presses a heavy purse into your hand. Small coins stained with salt-water, but together they amount to a tidy sum.

Description: Your crew teaches the Limpet a whole cycle of epically filthy sea shanties. At one point you could swear you hear your name inserted in one of the more complex verses, but you maintain a diplomatic silence.

		DefaultEvent
Name: A dislike of spies
Id: 149333
Description: You and one of your more villainous-looking zailors join a dice-game. (Villainous-looking: but you know for a fact that she tithes to charity and has a delightful singing voice.) The topic turns promisingly to pillage and ambush, but your zailor is a little too forward with her questions. There is a scuffle, and a stabbing. You escape: she does not.

Name: Scarecrow, scarecrow
Id: 149334
Description: You're eavesdropping on the captain of a lean black cutter when her first mate spots you. In the ensuing fracas, one of your crew is smashed through a flimsy wooden wall. He falls two hundred feet to be impaled on a smaller stalagmite in the shadow of the Mourn, and dies instantly. It's a painless death, but his slowly mummifying corpse will hang there for decades to come. Ships will salute it. Successive generations of children will name it, rename it, fling stones, dare each other to climb the pinnacle and kiss its fleshless hand.

		SuccessEvent
Name: Incaution
Id: 149335
Description: A steaming bath-house on a spur of rock. Water slops over the edge of tubs, out over the edge to join the zee far below. Scarred captains boast drunkenly of the prizes they've taken, and the victims they have marked out. You listen from the shadows.

		RareSuccessEvent
Name: Unusual activity
Id: 149336
Description: The whisper is that a Khanate trimaran resupplied here last week, under a flag of careful truce. That implies something interesting about Khanate fleet movements. The Admiralty would love to know.
