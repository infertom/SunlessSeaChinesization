Name: Employ rattus faber engineers
Id: 128194
Description: The rats of Fallen London are remarkably skilled engineers; and they know ships well. They are not, however, reliable. Payment is in kind, not currency. [This will repair some of your Hull. How much? Difficult to say.]

		DefaultEvent
Name: An unfortunate turn of events
Id: 149733
Description: Rats sweep over your ship like tide! Day and night, their tiny tools click. Your crew step over them cautiously. Unfortunately, some complex rat-vendetta is at play here: warring rat-families decide to use your ship as a battleground. They're quite well-behaved about it, and the damage is minimal - but an unfortunate passing zailor gets a rat-bullet through the eye and drowns in the Thames. You protest, but the contract is clear - there is an exception for 'ocular perturbations.'

Name: Open warfare
Id: 169525
Description: The rats are hardly an hour into their work when the trouble begins. Someone's surly, speechless rat-steed eats someone else's packed lunch. Someone's hot-blooded friend eats the rat-steed. The rats exchange cross words, then blows, then shots. The ensuing battle sweeps over your ship, and disappears down the dock. At least they didn't have time to eat much.

		SuccessEvent
Name: A benevolent infestation
Id: 149734
Description: Rats sweep over your ship like tide! Day and night, their tiny tools click. Your crew step over them cautiously. Eventually the rat-tide withdraws. How good a job have they done?

		RareSuccessEvent
Name: Something like Christmas
Id: 169526
Description: You wait for the rats to arrive. And wait. And wait. A whole night passes. That morning, you stamp down the gangplank in a state of some irritation... to find the ship in eerily perfect condition. Only one crate of supplies is missing. The rat-foreman seems as confused as you. He looks at his feet and sketches a sign with his finger, a looping conundrum of a symbol. He mutters something under his rat-breath. "Fungus"?

Name: Visit the Admiralty fuel stores
Id: 146421
Description: If you've done good work, the Admiralty will issue you with a book of little chitties. [This will exchange 1 point of Admiralty's Favour for 2-3 Fuel.]

		DefaultEvent
Name: Success, eventually
Id: 180625
Description: The good: free fuel. The bad: a half-hour argument with the quartermaster, who insists that your chitties have not been stamped by the Office of Incongruous Requests. Eventually, she grudgingly permits you to load your fuel-cart.

		ParentEvent

		SuccessEvent
Name: Success!
Id: 180626
Description: The quartermaster is not usually friendly, but you have enough zailor's jokes and harbour gossip to set her laughing nostalgically. She is remarkably liberal about the measurement of fuel.
