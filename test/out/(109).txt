Description: It's oddly difficult to die in Fallen London; but when a Londoner is too tatty and wretched to live, they wrap themselves in bandages and take ship for the Tomb-Colonies. Your crew cart these ones aboard in padded coffins. They'll sleep there until the journey is done. [The tomb-colonist is in your hold. Take them north to the colony of Venderbight, and sell them there.]

Description: One by one, they rise, uncomplainingly, with no trace of stiffness or discomfort from the long voyage. The deck resounds beneath their heavy tread. A shroomyard manager waits on dock, tapping her foot. "About time," she says. "Here's your payment. Come along, now, you. There's a good construct."

		DefaultEvent
Name: Welcome, blemmigan
Id: 159949
Description: Your blemmigan leaps from the rail of the ship to shelter in the stranger's greatcoat, and the stranger nods unsteadily. "We'll see to it," the fluting voice assures you. It places a box atop a quayside bollard - clumsily, its hand muffled in its sleeve. Then it's gone, leaving only an odour of marsh-mud lingering in the air. What's in the box?

Description: Your blemmigans swirl across the dock like clawed and violet fog. Up into the greatcoat, like squirrels into a shrub! "Thank you all," the figure flutes. "We have something for you - and we wanted you to have this, our work. Though it's unsigned, of course." It retreats into the dockside mist, leaving behind a dank odour; a packing-crate; and a volume of love poetry...

Description: A black carriage - stripped of livery - slows beside you. When the door opens, a veiled woman in midnight-blue gestures curtly. "In," she demands. 
<br/><br/>
You wait on a deep-cushioned seat. A furrow-browed old gentleman with a mild and sheeply gaze samples the honey. He nods approvingly. The upholstery smells like flowers and rust.
<br/><br/>
"Go," the veiled woman says. She tosses you a lacquered serpent-bracelet. It's freezing to the touch. Its mouth is stuffed with jewels.

<br/><br/>
You pass up the barrel, and they heft it as if it were empty. "I'm a terrible person," she tells you dolefully. "But so are you. And it tastes so sweet. Here's your money."
<br/><br/>
And they're off! with a cackle, a blown kiss, and a waft of cigar-smoke.

Id: 143693
Description: Slivvy is the fey and stuttering shaman-boy who speaks to the wind. Slivvy lives in the Flit, the rooftop kingdom of Fallen London, where urchins and anarchists lair. It's not far. But it is high. It won't be easy to get the Sphinxstone up there.

		DefaultEvent
Name: Step by step
Id: 176110
Description: You still have contacts in the urchin-gangs; you still have favours owed. Your skills and alliances and your knowledge of the Flit-ways is enough to get the stone up, though your zailors are green with terror by the end of it. "I want to go back to zee, captain!" one moans.
<br/><br/>
The urchin Slivvy has arranged cradles for the rocks. "We are going to drop them on people Storm doesn't like," he tells you. "Squash them f-f-flat. It's alright if a g-g-god tells you to do it." Is he joking? It's difficult to tell, with Slivvy. He leans forward and whispers the directions to the Backmost Stairs, the secret Flit-route that you've never travelled.

Your successor is prompt. He seems disinclined to look you in the eye. "We have instructions," he says quietly. "We require an altar, and we must use one of these - objects." He does look up, then. "Why? Who are you working for now? Does the Bazaar rule the Church? I don't understand. But they told me to give you this, and these."

Id: 176112
Description: <p>The Shrine moves constantly, but you have directions from Penstock. Tonight, it is here, at the bottom of a narrow flight of stairs that leads down to the Stolen River, that you find the shrine. It is hung with irrigo. Its altar is a stool, with the icon of St Joshua set upon it. You shield your eyes against the sapping colour. Already you've forgotten the route you took to come here. With luck, the zailors waiting above with the stone will not have wandered off.</p>
<p>"The Salt Lions," the Midnighter says breathily. "Oh yes, oh yes. That must be forgotten. Don't worry: we'll purge the stone of what remains. We're grateful to you, although you won't remember why - "</p>
<p>And now here you are behind the warehouses at the docks. Your hands and lips are cold. Here, in your pocket, is a tattered book.</p>
