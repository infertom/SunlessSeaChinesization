Name: Search the Church of the Starved Men
Id: 132108
Description: A cruciform chamber with a great altar, rows of rotting pews. Perhaps the windows once held stained glass. The altar is dripstone, painstakingly carved into organic shapes: jointed limbs, eye-bulbs, snapping claws, armoured excrescences.

		DefaultEvent
Name: 
Id: 155901
Description: An inscription on the altar reads SO ARE WEE SHAPEDE. The stonecraft is perfect, but the spelling seems eccentric. Two stone knives rest on its surface, along with a chunk of flint that might be a knife, a tool or simply a lump of rock.
<br/><br/>
Three human skulls wait in a niche at the back. Two have warped and lengthened jaws: the third has slumped and run like a melted candle, although it feels as solid as any bone to the touch.
<br/><br/>
What now? You can press on, but the going will get harder from here. Or you could turn back with your treasures.

		DefaultEvent
Name: 
Id: 156124
Description: "Imitatorsh," the Outcast burbles. "They shtole our Axile artsh. They fought. They would be ush." It shakes with rage or laughter, and collapses before the altar. "Shtill, the change remainsh. The change remainsh!"
<br/><br/>
It's the longest speech you've ever heard from it. It remains motionless in prayer while you search. An inscription on the altar reads SO ARE WEE SHAPEDE. The stonecraft is perfect, but the spelling seems eccentric. Two stone knives rest on its surface, along with a chunk of flint that might be a knife, a tool or simply a lump of rock.

Name: The Gate of Forms
Id: 132248
Description: Here - in the floor, because of the stalactite's fall - is a gate of glittering chalcedony, half-lost beneath rubble but thick enough to resist the most determined assault. Its surface is a relief of twisted limbs, distorted faces screaming in glee. (Carved? Moulded? Impossibly, natural?) A pit at its centre might be a key-socket, or only a mouth.

		DefaultEvent
Name: Making an entrance
Id: 156126
Description: Perhaps, once, the gate was finely counter-balanced. Perhaps, once, hidden machineries would have roared at the touch of the Eolith, and the gate would have swung open like oiled glass. Now, the Eolith only triggers the unlocking mechanism. It takes three sailors with crowbars to move the rubble and force the door open - down-open, so that when you bring it free, it collapses inwards with an echoing crash. Climb through the gap, into a space that roars with wind -

Name: The Root-Gallery
Id: 132262
Description: You've traversed half the length of the stalactite called Godfall, from the monastery to here. The Starved Men cut a tremendous gallery around the whole root of the stalactite, leaving a vast central pillar to support its weight. In its day, the view must have been unrivalled. Remnants of salvaged glass and wooden eating-houses, viewing-booths, sight-temples still cling to the edges - but the root has been shattered, and the stalactite fell.
<br/><br/>
Go a little closer - clamber carefully across the tilted surface of the gallery floor towards the shattered stump of the root.

		DefaultEvent
Name: 
Id: 156150
Description: A dozen corpses, decades-dry lie at the stalagmite's root. You think there was a barricade here, but the fall has smashed it and the remnants have fallen into the sea. Were they defending the root? Gunner Atkins squints at the scorched and shattered rock, and nods wisely. "Gunpowder," he opines. "Blew it up themselves. Killed the whole city. Starved Men, eh? Allus heard they fight each other. Mad as toads."
<br/><br/>
In the immemorial tradition of subterranean adventurers, you search the corpses. Well, it's not like they've been <i>buried</i>. Their bones of their limbs and faces are blurred and twisted, like melted wax... You find trinkets, disgusting remnant-chunks, and oh good God! Yes. Yes, that's worth a bit. Worth a lot. Best not let your men see it.
<br/><br/>
Nothing else remains here. Signal your ship with flares, and she'll approach: you can scramble down and drop into the zee, to be retrieved. Much safer than the tunnels of Godfall.

Description: You've been here before. The Starved Men cut a tremendous gallery around the whole root of the stalactite, leaving a vast central pillar to support its weight. In its day, the view must have been unrivalled. Remnants of salvaged glass and wooden eating-houses, viewing-booths, sight-temples still cling to the edges - but the root has been shattered, and the stalactite fell. Go a little closer - clamber carefully across the tilted surface of the gallery floor towards the shattered stump of the root.

		DefaultEvent
Name: 
Id: 156419
Description: The corpses by the stalactite-root still remain: but they lie in different attitudes. Or so you think. It's hard to be certain. You were here in the glimmering dark, and here you are in the glimmering dark again. Examine their contorted limbs, the shape of their distorted faces. Perhaps something occurs to you.

Name: Creep across a chasm
Id: 132103
Description: The stalactite has cracked right across. That crack is a plunging chasm. The dark sea thunders below. You can probably get across. After all, you are zailors. Zailors have rope.

		DefaultEvent
Name: One mishap
Id: 155890
Description: A single desperate scream: and the laggard at the back misses a foot-hold and plunges into the depths. There is a long moment of silence, and then, in unspoken unison, you all continue.

Description: It's harder in the candle-lit gloom than it would be in the deck of a ship. The crevices of the stalactite seem alive with eyes. But you all make it safely across.

Id: 132102
Description: One, two - six, seven, eight - a rabble of leathery mummy-things, mouths agape, comes boiling from crevices. Crooked limbs reach for you.

		DefaultEvent
Name: Retreat!
Id: 155889
Description: Your crew crumbles. They're not strong, these leather remnants, but they're terribly tenacious. Not dead exactly - half-living memories persisting on reflex and hate. Fall back. Fall back!

		SuccessEvent
Name: Push through
Id: 155892
Description: They're tenacious, these leather remnants, but not strong. Some force has distorted remants of women and men into ragged, furious mannequins. They still breathe, they still ate - bat-blood runs from the mouth of this one, before you take off its head with a swing of your cutlass. Then they're behind you, their roars of incredulous rage fading.

Name: A labyrinth of dwelling-galleries
Id: 132104
Description: You hear the zee! The passage branches and opens into a tangle of galleries on the skin of the surface. There are doorways to dwelling-places - all empty now, all leading into one another like cells of a honeycomb. Perhaps you can find your way through.

		DefaultEvent
Name: A confusion
Id: 155893

Id: 155894
Description: You make your way through an asymmetrical foam of beehive dwellings, past faded frescos of the sea seen from above, beneath swags of cobweb where single sorrow-spiders scuttle, past a long-mummied human corpse. Its limbs are curled and knotted like vines. What happened here?

		DefaultEvent
Name: Too many turns
Id: 155895
Description: It's the air. It must be the air. It tastes of bitumen and rust. But your vision blurs and your ears roar until you stagger into a zone where the air is clear. Two of your zailors are sobbing like children.

Name: Lost in amber
Id: 132176
Description: A spherical room. The ceiling drips honey; the walls and floor are glazed with warm orange-yellow. It's gives under your touch - slowly, but when you try to pull your hand free, it takes all your strength. Tables and chairs project through the yard-thick amber on the floor - enough to cross, perhaps.

		DefaultEvent
Name: A fall!
Id: 156014
Description: A zeeman at the back grows complacent. He dawdles too long on an amber-glazed table. His boot sticks when he tries to raise it. With a single scream he topples sideways into the grasping goo! His mates try to tug him free, but the stuff has an iron grip. The screaming goes on and on, until he sinks deep enough - the amber pushes its careless fist into his mouth, and finally he's silenced. Move on. Move on.

		SuccessEvent
Name: A safe crossing
Id: 156015
Description: You each step cautiously from chair to table to bench. Thankfully, the amber's grasp keeps the furniture from swaying too much. As you reach the far side, a careless crewman stumbles and the chair swings sideways with a clotted 'splorch' sound - but you've made it across.

Name: The Glittering Crisis

		DefaultEvent
Name: A nasty fall
Id: 156016
Description: Dazzled, you trip. A knife-length projection of crystal parts your pea-coat as if it were crepe paper. You lurch to the exit: your crew helps you bandage it as best they may. "Nasty cut," the bo'sun helpfully observes. "A little to the left and it'd bleed you like a Christmas pig."
