Name: Godfall
Id: 152324
Description: The brawling bearded men who live here call themselves monks. They pay lip service to 'St Stalactite', which fell from the roof. But their chief interests seem to be wine, blood and shouting.

Name: Explore the Shattered Citadel
Id: 129820
Description: Before the stalactite was a monastery - before it ever fell from the roof - it was a citadel. The fall shattered it and killed all its occupants. Probably. Why don't you take a look? [The more Foxfire Candles you have, the better. Bad things will happen if you run out.]

		DefaultEvent
Name: Through the cellars
Id: 152325
Description: The monks have blocked the tunnels into the Citadel. "The Starved Men lived there," one says vaguely. "They're all dead of course, but you still wouldn't want to meet them." Still, there's a gap in the cellar wall that they keep meaning to fix -

Description: Offer them a hunting-trophy as a gift for their collection

		DefaultEvent
Name: Louder, ever-louder
Id: 154680
Description: The trophy inspires the monks to feasts of bragging. This one broke a giant Albino Moray's neck. That one wrestled a Heptycheer. A third punched his way out of a Bound-Shark. A fourth... and so on. You are largely forgotten, but there are truths of note in among all the tipsy boasting.

Description: Let them tell you about past and present events in the monastery.

		DefaultEvent
Name: Tales
Id: 154683
Description: They're eager to talk about their history. The stalactite, they assure you, was one of the citadels of the Starved Men who dwell in the roof. When it fell, a few of its occupants survived to become the monks' progenitors. How does that work, you wonder, with their vow of celibacy? They become vague, and are suddenly eager to speak of the details of passing shipping.

Id: 131315
Description: The throats of the Brothers are dry. They'll pay for something to moisten them.

		DefaultEvent
Name: A half-dozen currencies
Id: 154684
Description: Mostly Echoes, but here's Khanate paper money, the whimpering coins of Polythreme, and a strange glass token that might be from far Irem. "Donations," the Abbot-Captain affirms. "Pilgrims are generous."

Name: Of more wine
Id: 131317
Description: "Oh, no," the Abbot-Commander says sternly. "We've had too much trouble with this. The brothers can't shoot straight. Take the nasty stuff away."

		DefaultEvent
Name: A hard bargain
Id: 154686
Description: Is it a real objection, or a negotiating position? Perhaps a bit of both. Eventually he relents and takes a quantity of wine off your hands, but at a pretty wretched price.

Description: The Shouting Monks revel in battle. Their Abbot-Commander is a savage veteran of a hundred duels and monster-hunts.

Name: Outrage!
Id: 177797
Description: "We do not fight women," one sneers. "If we wanted to fight women, we'd be over at Abbey Rock."
<br/><br/>
"You're not over at Abbey Rock," the Adventuress suggests, "because the Sisters' training is so very much deadlier."
<br/><br/>
"Then fight them!" the monk responds haughtily.
