Name: The zee...
Id: 148105
Description: The Navigator likes to talk about the zee. He has long opinions on its beauties, its dangers, its salinity, its depth and its contents -  and the rest. Every other sentence starts 'The zee...' Zee, zee, zee... After a while you reach the point of semantic satiation, and the word 'zee' means no more to you than the word 'zop'. But you zeem to have learnt something.

Name: Discreet delights
Id: 180994
Description: The Navigator is rather earnest, and given to displays of slightly unnerving enthusiasm; but like any good navigator, he knows his way around, and understands the importance of timing. You are more than satisfied by the time you both drift off to sleep.
