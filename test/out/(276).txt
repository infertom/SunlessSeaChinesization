Description: The Cook has converted pots into kettle-drums. The Quartermaster has improvised pan-pipes. That squint-eyed fellow from Shepherd's Wash has brought out an actual fiddle. They set up on a dark beach lit by torches on poles, and do eight folk-songs, a mischievous music-hall number called The Empress Likes Them Quiet, and an odd restless little tune like a caged cat. "My own composition," the Washman confides.

Name: A gloomy inspiration
Id: 146899
Description: Afterwards, you can't remember where you first heard the tune, or why you thought it was a good idea. But once you begin it - an arrogant, mocking thing in waltz time - you can't seem to stop. Your companions follow you like men possessed. The audience rise to their feet: they stamp and moan and sway. Far off across the zee, a sound like thunder joins your chorus. When you stop, it's silent for the longest time.
