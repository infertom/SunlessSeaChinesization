Description: The hour of confidence is drawing to its end. If there is anything else you need to do, now is the time.

Name: Set off a flare, allowing you to see everyone
Id: 139119
Description: You will see everything. [This will certainly get you kicked off the island.]

		DefaultEvent
Name: Ouch
Id: 168629
Description: The light is so sudden, so searing, that someone screams. All around you are... all sorts of things. Some are human, but you see other faces: rubbery, clay, some unrecognizably altered. The Chief Geometer, with his mask off, doesn't seem to be bothering to wear a face at all. Many faces are wet with tears. No one welcomes the blaze of light.
<br/><br/>
Someone throws a cloak over the flare: a mistake, because of course it only begins to burn. After that someone manages to douse both flare and cloak. (Who in this crowd was carrying a bucket of water?) But it is put out, and someone's hands are clamped firm around your wrist.
<br/><br/>
And that is the last that you see of Visage. You are taken blind back to the docks, your face covered in a black cloth that is no mask at all.

Name: Out, out out

Description: The light is so sudden, so searing, that someone screams. All around you are... all sorts of things. Some are human, but you see other faces: rubbery, clay, some unrecognizably altered.

<br/><br/>
You do get out, though. You're escorted back up the tunnel, double-quick, and no business about having to wait your turn in an endless file of people. The cold sea air is on your face.

Name: Shine a light on the bat-faced figure
Id: 139121
Description: Really it's just him you want to understand. [This will certainly get you kicked off the island.]



		DefaultEvent
Name: Bat
Id: 168631
Description: You hood the flare inside a lantern, but it's still distressfully bright in here.
<br/><br/>
You shine the light on your companion. A man only, with a broad nose that looks like it has been broken repeatedly, and a missing tooth, and scars about the neck as though he has been executed many times. He gives you a sad, sheepish grin. 
<br/><br/>
"Nothing to see here," he says. "And they'll be putting me to death again soon enough, so you needn't have bothered."
<br/><br/>
Already the others are swarming on him. Before your light goes out, you catch a glimpse of a noose, ready in someone's hand. The bats are not welcome here, it seems.
<br/><br/>
Though after your violation of the mask-darkness, you aren't welcome either.

Description: Let the ceremony end according to the proper rites.

Name: Last bell
Id: 168632
Description: At the end of the hour there comes a woman with a feather of shimmering silver, which she tucks into your hand. Symbol of the innocent heart that will not be eaten by the jackal. 
<br/><br/>
Then a bell rings and the time of speech is over. You all begin to put your masks back on. It is possible - you cannot know for sure - that in this cover someone has exchanged a mask with someone else.
<br/><br/>
It is an orderly and perfect line that emerges again from the ear of Flourishing-of-Years. If anyone watches from above, they must surely be satisfied.
