Name: Vienna
Id: 151453
Description: The capital of the Dual Monarchy has seen better days. The palaces still glitter, but the mood is uneasy. Every third wall seems daubed with graffiti, only rarely in German: UNITY OR DEATH and REMEMBER LONDON and THE LIBERATION OF NIGHT.
<br/><br/>
Radical elements have taken to smashing the gas-lamps with flung stones. At least that means it's decently dark at night.

		DefaultEvent
Name: "Aaaahhh..."
Id: 151454
Description: The Proprietor's sorrowful expression vanishes. His eyebrows bristle. Even his ears seem to prick up. "My friend, this is extraordinary. What flavours do I detect? Cinnamon? Jasmine? is that... bat guano? The vitality of this substance! The energy!"
<br/><br/>
His enthusiasm dissipates abruptly. "Yes. Yes, I suppose it will do. I'll pay you eighty kronen - whatever that is in your peculiar subterranean currency - for every sack you bring me. Perhaps it will do this poor old place some good. Anything's possible, I suppose."

Id: 153901
Description: "Each day - " the Proprietor waves at the bustling blaze of the Café " - we draw a little nearer to bankruptcy. Your coffee helps delay our demise, if only by a week or two. I am grateful, I suppose. Here: this is all I can afford to pay you."

Name: A dinner with a gentleman from the Bureau
Id: 153903
Description: A fierce old fellow listens intently to your account, and dispatches agents to arrest the Agitator. "We are grateful," he says. "I shall not insult you by offering you payment. But I must invite you to dine with me before you leave."
<br/><br/>
No payment? But the dinner conversation is rich with valuable information. Perhaps the old fellow is using you as a pawn in some scheme of his own. No matter: the Admiralty would love to hear this.
