Name: Tough and grey
Id: 153031
Description: The shark-meat is dark, springy and oily. These are not encouraging properties for a meal. Nevertheless, your cook, perhaps, can make something of it. And what's this in its gut?

		DefaultEvent
Name: The geometries of agony
Id: 155744
Description: How did it move? How could it move? The shapes it formed - the leaps it managed - the impossible gyrations - it was as if its pain forced - permitted - it to move in directions not normally perceptible to our eyes.

		SuccessEvent
Name: Digging deeper
Id: 153029
Description: The cage has begun to distort its shape - more than seems reasonable, but then a shark has no bones. Rods of iron inserted deep into its flesh have done impossible things.
