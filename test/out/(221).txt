Description: Then she tells you what happened before. She was a doctor, healing the malaise of countesses and publishing research about the applications of mushroom-derived spirits.

<br/>
Her twin lived with her, at her expense, but preferred more bohemian entertainments. The Acolyte describes what their life together was: sepia anatomical charts next to dream-animals done in viridian paint. Prisoner's Honey jostling retorts full of medicine. Silk scraps in the bandage drawer. 
<br/>
<br/>
The twin is gone now: something about an accident, a footbath full of silvery fluid, skin cracked and frozen. A resuscitation attempt that went wrong, preventing any return from death. 
<br/>
<br/>
Afterward her memories are blurred, until they pick up again here. She regards her present occupation as penance of some kind.

Description: When you ask, she answers, grimly, with anatomical precision. How the twin had returned in bad shape from a shared dream. How her skin was covered with a tracery of bleeding lines. The shock this caused to the body. The inevitable death.
<br/>
<br/>
After the explanation, she returns to her work. It seems the interview is at an end.
