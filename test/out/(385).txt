Name: The Throne-Cyst
Id: 169643
Description: This is the salt-blown heart of the Hold. The Fathomking floats in his throne: a gem-starred bowl of sea-stone, the size of a banqueting table. He's wearing a dressing gown of purple brocade, soaked dark with salt water. He leans his chin calmly on his hand. Beneath the surface of the water in his throne, his hidden regions pulse, constantly, insistently.

Description: Guards in thorned exoskeletons issue from a dark slit behind the throne. The Campaigner walks between them, wrists chained with bronze, face calm and empty.
<br/><br/>
"The flames," the Fathomking remarks, "have been quenched in the zee. Is she as she was? Not entirely. But you will be unable to discern any differences that might trouble you."

Name: "I have come to plead for a zailor's life."
Id: 139734
Description: Perhaps it's someone you knew. Perhaps you're feeling philanthropic. Perhaps you're simply desperate for crew. [This is an expensive way to gain crew.]

		DefaultEvent
Name: 
Id: 169647
Description: A wall puckers open, and a guard in a thorned exoskeleton brings in a shivering zailor. "Captain!" she cries. "I was - it was - the cold - "
<br/><br/>
"Go," the Fathomking says languidly. "I won't release her twice."

Id: 139736
Description: Two silent guards in thorned exoskeletons drag a babbling Drownie forwards. "No!" she shrieks. "I am no friend of spiders! I have never purchased silk! It was a gift! Your Complexity! I have always been loyal - "

		DefaultEvent
Name: A spray of seawater
Id: 169649
Description: The guards fling the Drownie into the pool. The splash soaks the King, but his dignity is unmarred. The pulsing in the pool intensifies into threshing. The Drownie sinks from view, and the waters grow thick and dark. "Next," the King says peaceably.

Name: Watch a Crocodile-Masked Visitor make an offering
Id: 139739
Description: A body lies on a bier in the centre of the chamber. The Crocodile-Masked Visitor moves around it, indicating wounds in its head, neck, chest; muttering.

		DefaultEvent
Name: Boasting?
Id: 169652
Description: He's speaking of the nature of the wounds - their dramatic effects on the landscapes of the body. He sounds like he's boasting - but a single tear trickles down from beneath his mask. At last the King nods. "The offering is acceptable," he says. Thorn-armoured guards carry the bier through a dark slit behind his throne.
<br/><br/>
The King begins, off-handedly, to outline the cartography of the deep undersea, and the patrol-routes of monsters. He notices your presence and snaps his fingers: the guard ushers you out, but not before you've heard valuable deep-gossip.

		DefaultEvent
Name: Valuable information
Id: 169653
Description: At last the King nods, and awards the Emissary a pouch of drowning-pearls. The hour of audience is past. Thorn-armoured guards escort you back to the surface. But the Emissary's words, and the King's questions, have taught you a great deal.

Name: Listen to a Chelonate Envoy
Id: 139741
Description: A hunter in sharkskin is haranguing the King. "...unpardonable intrusion! Our ancient rights have been impugned! King you may be, but not of the Shell-Slayers. We will pay no more tribute - "

		DefaultEvent
Name: An abrupt end
Id: 169654
Description: The King makes a chopping motion with his hand. A tide of crabs rushes from the shadows of the Throne-Cyst. They're on the hunter before he can turn, but not before he can scream. The King watches in satisfaction as they swarm the hunter, snipping the flesh from his bones. Thorn-armoured guards block the chamber door.
<br/><br/>
When it's done; when his cries are long silenced, and scarred bones remain - the King motions you forwards. "Take something," he commands. "Let our justice be remembered above. You may go."

Id: 139752
Description: Crocodile moves around a corpse-offering on a bier, clockwise. He indicates its wounds to the Fathomking. Why is he here?

		DefaultEvent
Name: Another rite
Id: 169674
Description: Crocodile is describing the wounds on the body, but the wounds he describes don't match the wounds you see. This is another Visage ritual. He sounds like he's boasting - but a single tear trickles down from beneath his mask. At last the King nods. "The offering is acceptable," he says. Thorn-armoured guards carry the bier through a dark slit behind his throne.

The King begins, off-handedly, to outline the cartography of the deep undersea, and the patrol-routes of monsters. He notices your presence and snaps his fingers. The guard ushers you out, but not before you've heard valuable deep-gossip. And you understand a little more Visage-lore. Crocodile has given this body to another kind of flood.

Name: Attend the Poissonnier's feast
Id: 147281
Description: The Drownie court - soggy, chattering, hungry - populate a table of carved coral. The Poissonnier claps his hands. Your crew scurry in with steaming plates.

		DefaultEvent
Name: The Seventh Miracle
Id: 181958
Description: There are seven courses, each named. It begins with <i>The First Touch on the Skin</i>: a plate of silky white flesh submerged in yellow sauce - fresh, sharp, shocking. Next comes <i>Struggling Against the Current</i>, a fierce terrine of coursing flavours. It leaves the diners watery-eyed and reaching for their wine. Before they recover, bowls of peligin soup are set before them. <i>"Swallowed!"</i> the Poissonier intones. The taste is deep and rich and heavy, lining the stomach. Several drownies lift the bowls to their lips to catch the last drops.
<br/><br/>
A merciful interlude follows. <i>The Surface, High Above</i> is a mild, palate-cleansing mousse. Afterwards comes <i>Lost Breath</i> - a roulade of still-wriggling tentacles; bitter on the tongue's tip, but departing with a long, mellow aftertaste as it slides down the throat. The penultimate course <i>The Abandonment of the Self</i> is spun with sugar and crunchy with salt. Spherical cages of solidified syrup, containing fiery sweetmeats. The filigree cracks between Drownie teeth. The sweetmeats slide down damp throats.
<br/><br/>
Last of all, <i>The Promise of What is to Follow</i> - a brûléed cream of inexplicable pungency - indescribably more-ish. The diners lean back, bloated. When their senses return, they call for the Poissonnier and congratulate him upon impeccably reproducing the sensation of drowning in culinary form. "It was not drowning," the Fathomking says, his baritone rolling over their babble. "It was love." He raises his glass to the Poissonnier.
