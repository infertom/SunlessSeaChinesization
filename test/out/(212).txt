Name: Departure in Darkness
Id: 152413
Description: The mirror-edges and broken shards glint menacingly in the new-fallen darkness of Varchas: are there strange shapes in them? Do you hear them hiss and whisper and taunt? You feel a horrible sense of wrongness, but dismiss it as hunger or nerves. Surely you have done the right thing?

Description: "We will never forget you, Taamas!" The Jewel-Turbaned Youth laughs suddenly, chagrined. "I do not know why I call you that still. We are all Taamas now."
<br/><br/>
There is triumph in his eyes, but also a glinting madness that was not there before. You wonder if the mirrors are whispering to him. You wonder if he has been whispering back.
<br/><br/>
You wonder many things, but it is not your place. You leave Varchas behind you, to piece itself back together again.
