Description: Here is a writhing organ, there a twitching limb. Your ship slows as it navigates a slick of stinking, dying spider-flesh awash with bluish, copper-smelling blood. You see and learn more than you'd ever wish. There! There, in that tubule-sheath! Haul it out with a boat-hook. What is it?
<br/><br/>
There will always be another <i>Tree of Ages</i>. The sorrow-spiders are patient, and numberless. But you have this one's heart.

Description: You skirt a slick of stinking, dying spider-flesh awash with bluish, copper-smelling blood. Faces form in the bubbles at its edges. Voices cry out in the languages spoken between the stars. The sorrow-spiders have come far, to lair in this place, and now you have ended their fierce lives. There will be more. There will always be more.
