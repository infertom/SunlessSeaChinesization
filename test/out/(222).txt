Name: Singsong and Bishoprics
Id: 149081
Description: They're singing to themselves and carrying lenses of some sort, and they know enough to be looking through the most recent part of the pile. It's plain someone's tipped them off about a particularly juicy scandal that has just lately been discarded.

<br/>
<br/>
Before they finish their search, you take them by surprise and send them scrambling. They even drop something in the process.
