Name: Receive an Embassy
Id: 144251
Description: Any pirate in a hut can raise a flag. You're much more than that, now - the governor of a thriving settlement. But to be taken seriously as a nation, you must be formally recognised, and make an alliance. Who is your chosen ally?

Name: A pact with Khan's Shadow
Id: 124663
Description: The Shadow is desperate for allies... but they're mistrustful. If your Viceroy is someone who knows their ways, and if you have an introduction from their friends, then they'll work with you.

Name: Shadow's Respect
Id: 144253
Description: The anarch ambassador attends you in your study. He paces back and forth, gesturing with his glittering gloves, listing rationales for allying with a self-proclaimed monarch. You are the lesser evil. You have shown that you are sympathetic to their cause. One day, perhaps, you will free your island from your own tyranny. You wait for him to finish.
<br/><br/>
Anarchs do not kneel, and they are the enemies of rulership. Nevertheless, this one gives you a grudging nod. You are a powerful ally, and they must needs respect you. This is your kingdom. London is where you began - but now, this is your home. From a ship's captain to a nation's founder is a long journey indeed. Who knows where the journey will take you?

[Congratulations! You have completed a hidden Ambition. We do apologise. We meant to say: you have completed a hidden Ambition... your Majesty.]

Name: An accommodation with London
Id: 149343
Description: The Empire doesn't like its subjects founding rival nations. But honestly, there's not much they can do about it, and the Empire's power is on the wane. If you are credibly powerful - and if you have enough sway at the Admiralty - perhaps you can persuade them to wink at you.

Name: London's Respect
Id: 185293
Description: The Weary Ambassador comes armed for negotiation. Each proposal, she claims, is absolute, final and categorical; each proves, when challenged, to be none of those things. No, you do not wish to govern in the Empress' name. No, dominion status is not sufficient. No, you do not acknowledge that the Empress has gifted you the land. You are a monarch, or nothing.
<br/><br/>
The Ambassador shrugs - this is obviously what she expected - and, at last, she bows deeply. She is only the representative of a monarch - and you are a monarch. This is your kingdom. London is where you began - but now, this is your home. From a ship's captain to a nation's founder is a long journey indeed. Who knows where the journey will take you?

Description: Never mind staking a claim. You'll forge that claim in blood and fire. If anyone tries to take it from you, you'll fling it back at them.

Name: Blood and ow!
Id: 185296
Description: The first week, you fight off a raiding party from the Isle of Cats. The second week, you suffer an assault by Unfinished Pirates. The third, you drive off a Khanate trimaran which has apparently taken a dislike to your kitchen garden, and shells your cucumbers into paste. Every fight takes its toll. The graveyard begins to grow.
<br/><br/>
Can you really defend yourself as an independent nation? You've survived so far; but perhaps it's time to rethink this.

Name: Blood and fire
Id: 185297
Description: The first week, a raiding party from the Isle of Cats attacks. Not one survives. You mount gibbets on the beach to display their remains. The second week, you suffer an assault by Unfinished Pirates. You crush them all to rubble. Now you have a rock garden. The third, a Khanate trimaran takes a dislike to your kitchen garden, and shells your cucumbers into paste. You capture it, rename it, make it the second vessel in your navy.
<br/><br/>
Exactly one week later, a Royal Navy corvette puts marines ashore to pacify your 'robber state'. You're ready for them. You send them home safe, and keep the corvette.
<br/><br/>
One month after that, the Empire asks leave to send an ambassador...
<br/><br/>
This is your kingdom. London is where you began - but now, this is your home. From a ship's captain to a nation's founder is a long journey indeed. Who knows where the journey will take you?

Name: An understanding with the Presbyterate
Id: 149344
Description: The nation at the heart of the Elder Continent is older than London and the Khanate put together. They have an entire government department devoted to mithridacy - the art of confusing foreigners. Perhaps - just perhaps - you can work out the right thing to say to them.

A single line comes back, inscribed on a flake of flint. It reads: "TRAVELLER RETURNING."

Description: You send your message, and wait.
<br/><br/>
A representative of the College of Mortality arrives a week later, in one of the Presbyterate's notorious living ships. It stains the waters around it red with blood. He is dressed in the best formal Imperial style - shirt and tailcoat unmistakably tailored in London. He is courteous and pleasant and very, very vague. He does condescend to lower his ear to your mouth to listen to what you have to say.
<br/><br/>
You speak the words you've learnt - the opening lines of a treaty made between the Presbyterate and a certain other power, long before London fell, long before the Bazaar ever came to the Neath -
<br/><br/>
Immediately, his demeanour changes. He smiles with real warmth. "Well done," he says. "We recognise your claim." He bows.
<br/><br/>
This is your kingdom. London is where you began - but now, this is your home. From a ship's captain to a nation's founder is a long journey indeed. Who knows where the journey will take you?

Name: Overtures to the Khanate
Id: 124662
Description: The Khanate is not easily impressed. You'll need to master the proper forms of address, and the proper literary allusions - tremendously difficult, even for the best-educated barbarian. You'll need the favour of the Leopard, the royal clan. And you'll need to send a suitable gift.

		DefaultEvent
Name: No reply
Id: 144252
Description: You send your gift and your message... and wait. And wait... and wait... and wait. Perhaps it was lost at zee. Perhaps they're chuckling indulgently over some error of composition. Perhaps the insult is so grave that even now a Khanate war-fleet is steaming towards you...

Name: Leopard's Respect
Id: 185299
Description: The representative of the Leopard attends you in your study. She is resplendent. Her silks would purchase your ship: her jewels would probably purchase your island. The Khanate battleship that idles off your coast could level your mansion in an hour.
<br/><br/>
Nevertheless, she kneels, and touches her forehead to the floor, before she begins to talk business. She is only the representative of a monarch - and you are a monarch. This is your kingdom. London is where you began - but now, this is your home. From a ship's captain to a nation's founder is a long journey indeed. Who knows where the journey will take you?
