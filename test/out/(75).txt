Id: 150638
Description: Now and then, rocky fragments fall from the roof of the Neath. The decks of older ships are pocked with scars. The sound is one no land-lubber knows, and no zailor will ever forget.

Name: A simple rite
Id: 150642
Description: Your zailors know the words: you mumble them. A gift of wine and fish is suitable, marked with the Captain's blood (ow!), bound with copper wire and cast overboard from the bow. The package bobs for a moment, and then is sucked beneath the ship...
