Name: A fruitless struggle
Id: 149096
Description: The Snuffer is terribly strong. She smashes away your cutlass with the back of her hand. With her other hand, she peels away her face like the mask it is. Beneath it is a weeping gnarl of hungry red flesh. It's the last thing you ever see.

Name: Gadzooks!
Id: 149102
Description: "Die, skin-eater!" your comrade yells as he raises the cudgel. "This is for Jaffers!" What?
<br/><br/>
You roll away, shouting frantically, "Human! Human! I thought it was you!" Somehow, the pair of you establish a tenuous trust. It seems you are both, in fact, people, and the people-eating thing has gone. No trace of it remains... but a life-boat is missing. Something drove it to abandon you.


		SuccessEvent
Name: A desperate victory
Id: 149097
Description: You meet beneath the flare of the last bridge glim-lamps. In this half-light, with its stolen face askew, it's hard to imagine how it ever deceived you. It's as strong as strangling kelp, and its breath stinks of blood and hot flint. But you bear it down, wear its resolve away, skewer it through the heart with your boot-knife.
<br/><br/>
Roll it overboard. Watch it bob away into the dark. Now you need to work out how to get home.

		RareSuccessEvent
Name: O misery!
Id: 149103
Description: You ambush your comrade and smash their skull... and to your dismay, you find that their face is their own. Good God. You're all alone: and you're a murderer.
<br/><br/>
No trace of the Snuffer remains... but a life-boat is missing. Something drove it to abandon you. It could be worse.

Name: Spare him
Id: 127817
Description: It's just possible that the Snuffer has already left the ship: that you're both human. You could lay down your arms, and trust the other zailor.

		DefaultEvent
Name: That was unwise
Id: 149098
Description: You watch for a long time...and then she raises her gaff-hook too. With her other hand, she peels away her face comes like the mask it is. Beneath it is a weeping gnarl of hungry red flesh. It's the last thing you ever see.

Name: Quite a relief
Id: 149099
Description: You watch for a long time...and then she lays down her gaff-hook too. You essay a cautious, back-slapping embrace. Where's the Snuffer? No trace of it remains... but a life-boat is missing. Something drove it to abandon you.
