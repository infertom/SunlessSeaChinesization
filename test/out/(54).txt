Description: [This option is only available to those who have already turned cannibal.]

		DefaultEvent
Name: Appetites satisfied
Id: 147225
Description: You and your cannibal acolytes have selected your next victim. Behind closed doors, you wait, watch, and strike. You are merciful: your knives are sharp. The rest of the crew will benefit from a nourishing, anonymous stew. Perhaps they know nothing: perhaps they don't want to know.

Name: Drink Zzoup
Id: 132106
Description: The taste is acquired, rather than popular. But no one is likely to be fussy just now.

		DefaultEvent
Name: A soupcon of superstition
Id: 155899
Description: "Tastes like sulphur," growls the engineer's mate. But he tucks in with the rest.

Name: Consume a Strange Catch
Id: 126570
Description: It doesn't look appetising, or even safe, but perhaps it's worth the risk...

		DefaultEvent
Name: Unfit for human consumption
Id: 147226
Description: A volunteer takes a cautious nibble. "It tastes good," she says. "Rather salmony." She takes a larger bite. "Something like, erk, yark, gork, fruh." By "fruh" she is stone dead on the deck, her face a peculiar mauve. You dispose safely of the rest of the catch.

Name: Adventures in marine cuisine
Id: 147228
Description: The Cook converts it to a sort of minimalist bouillabaisse. It's salty and peculiar, but it does something for your crew's hunger...

Name: Consume a Live Specimen
Id: 126571
Description: It's not attractive, but at least it's fresh.

		DefaultEvent
Name: An escape!
Id: 147227
Description: As the Cook bears it to the pot, it displays unexpected agility! It escapes, flops frantically across the galley, and is gone through the open port-hole before Cook can reclaim it.

		SuccessEvent
Name: Noble service
Id: 147229
Description: The Live Specimen's end is sadly unceremonious. It's come so far, only to be consumed: but now it gives noble service. Cook knocks it on the head with a fisherman's priest and pops it in the pan. The taste is a little ammoniac, but no one complains. Or dies.

Description: Ask the Bandaged Poissonnier to render a Strange Catch edible.

		DefaultEvent
Name: "Alas - "
Id: 152807
Description: He returns a sad shake of his bandaged head. "Even I, with all my powers, cannot make this safe. Not here. Had I all my knives and vessels of home, perhaps. I have done my best with it, to no avail. But listen. This is what I found nested in its brain-pipe - "

		SuccessEvent
Name: A particular success!
Id: 152808
Description: The Poissonnier labours mightily to render the Strange Catch appetising. He succeeds, although with his usual effect: every third mouthful, you wonder whether you enjoy the flavour at all. But, yes, surely. It is spicy and salty and filling. Although, that lurking under-flavour -

Name: Bandaged Chef-Paramount
Id: 147441
Description: Ask him to render a Strange Catch edible.

		DefaultEvent
Name: "Alas - "
Id: 182203
Description: "It cannot be done. I have distilled, I have fermented, I have rarefied, I have sublimated, I have toasted. Every part of this creature - down to its last atom - tastes like the bosun's socks." He holds up a bandaged hand. "Do not ask me how I know. There is nothing I will not do in pursuit of culinary exploration."

Name: A particular success!
Id: 182204
Description: His braising-alembic rattles. His athanor-stove roars! He emerges from the galley with a bubbling pot. The crew cheers. As ever, the meal is both delightful and terrifying. Your tongue fizzes. Your eyes water. Your stomach panics, but surrenders hastily.
