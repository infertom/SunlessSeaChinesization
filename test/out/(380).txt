Name: Adam's Way
Id: 143316
Description: To the south: the Elder Continent, and the seventy-two cornucopian kingdoms of the Presbyterate. Are the stories true - rivers of honey; castles of ivory? 
Who can say? Foreigners (that's you) are forbidden from the interior. The closest most get is Adam's Way: a shouting, feasting, thieving, riot of a port. [The options available may change as the day progresses.]

Name: Deliver Sphinxstone for Penstock

Description: A tilted temple squats in the shade of a gumheart shroom. This is where Penstock sent you. Your zailors drag the stones, complaining as zailors generally do.

		DefaultEvent
Name: The Temple of the Mountain's Mother
Id: 143317
Description: The priestess wears Bazaar-black. Her eyes are lost in the snaking coils of her hair. "The altar is here," she intones. She holds out a bag of coins to you, and points to the floor. "Yes. That block. Place it here. Put the others in the sea. Only one is worthy."
<br/><br/>
A trial of blocks. A sacrifice of stones. How quaint! Then the priestess leans over, to whisper the reason for it: the Birth, the Heart, the Chain. Your head spins. You stagger outside to recover. The doors slam shut. Fortunately, you hung on to your coins.

		DefaultEvent
Name: A distant light
Id: 143318
Description: You both climb a hill to look out over the estuary. The zee curls below; smoke rises from chimneys; the Mountain glimmers on the horizon.
<br/><br/>
"You call her Stone, don't you?" the Adventuress says. "The Mountain, I mean. It's as good a name as any other. We have too many names for her. One for every day of the year... I could never get them right. And I resented her. I still do. She has all that life to give, and none of it for me. Because my bloody father got greedy."
<br/><br/>
She snorts. "The Bazaar is the Mountain's mother, they say. Or her father. I don't understand how these things work. I wonder if she ever complains about her parents."

<br/><br/>
The Prester is on the verge of declaring the Dawn Machine a blasphemy. London's bureaucracy is riddled with the children of the Thief-of-Faces. An expedition of foreigners recently put to shore to the west, then went south in search of the Garden. They were discovered, and given to the red river.

Description: "Or 'Snuffers' to children and Londoners. Awful creatures. Eat candles. Steal faces. Erasing them is a sacrament. An associate of mine recently found one in Port Carnelian, but before he could expose it he disappeared. Maybe the Snuffer got him. Or perhaps one of the Port's spies - the place is stuffed with them."
<br/><br/>
"Your commission is to root out Port Carnelian's Snuffer. Capture it. Bring it back here. I'd like to ask it a question or two." He pops a fig into his mouth.

		DefaultEvent
Name: A job well done
Id: 180658
Description: "Excellent! Roll it on in, my friend! I owe you another lunch, I think. But first, your payment." He hands you a large cream envelope. Inside is a chart, its folds stiff with zee-salt. The corner is stamped with the seal of the Empress herself. It is labelled 'First voyage of the <i>Galatea</i>, 1867' and shows a tenuous, roving course across the Unterzee.
<br/><br/>
As you leave, the Avuncular Broker is keen to keep in touch. "Perhaps I will have another commission for you after a conversation with our mutual friend." He pats the top of the barrel. The thing inside kicks.

		DefaultEvent
Name: Fruitless
Id: 181693
Description: The branch is too far, the nut too small, your hand too slow. When it strikes the paved square, the nut bursts into brief, pointless life. Threadlike shoots squirm out, groping for water. Desperate roots claw at a crack in the stone. It's no good. Its strength spent, the shoot browns, stiffens, and expires.

It ricochets from branch to branch as it falls. Your hand snaps out! The nut lands in your palm: glossy, smooth and brown. A number of passers-by cheer your catch.

London's Dilmun Club has appealed to the Presbyter for permission to approach the Mountain. Years ago, a director of the Mithridate Office resigned from his position and retired to the Shepherd Isles. Someone has been promising Snuffers forgiveness in exchange for service.

Description: This time he meets you in a private room. A lady in a neat, buttoned suit sits beside him, flicking through an English phrasebook. She seems quietly pleased.
<br/><br/>"Sit, sit," the Broker urges. His avuncularity is diminished. "The Snuffer you caught was extremely surprised by its interrogation: it was under the impression that it was working for <i>us</i>. One of our London diplomats has decided that the expedience of using Snuffers outweighs the prohibition on associating with them. He is incorrect."
<br/><br/>He introduces his associate, a Hands-On Diplomat. "I'd like you to see her safely to the Presbyterate embassy in London. She will explain her colleagues error to him, and replace him in his position. Thereupon, she will pay you. The payment is generous. It covers your discretion as well as your service."
