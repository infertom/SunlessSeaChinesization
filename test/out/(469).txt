Name: The Webbed Port
Id: 167221
Description: Blackness, webs, spiders, slaves. What remains of the Nativity remains for the sorrow-spiders' convenience and at their diminishing pleasure. Soon it will be absorbed. Lost. Forgotten. A brave survivor promises to sell you Fuel and Supplies if you swear to leave. He will not sail with you. He will wait for any other ship.

Description: Dark and dank: just how they like it.

		DefaultEvent
Name: An unseemly brawl
Id: 182370
Description: The blemmigan whirls across the quay and under an upturned boat, occasioning some alarm. Gone from your life! Your duty is done!
<br/><br/>
Not quite. With a furious insectile screech, sorrow-spiders converge on the boat. The blemmigan is driven into the open! It smashes one spider-carapace with its beak, vaults another spider in a flash of fungal dexterity, fences tendril-to-chelicerae with a third as they both dash up a wall. Then it's gone into the webs, its hyphal slimes protecting him from their sticky adhesions. Spiders pour after it. Who will know its end? Not you. You had nothing to do with this. If anyone asks, you were probably never even here.
