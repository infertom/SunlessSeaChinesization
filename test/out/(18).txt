		DefaultEvent
Name: A firkin of honey
Id: 140907
Description: This is what they call prisoner's honey, wrung by the lamplighter bee from the exile's rose. "I wonder 'oo made up all these names," remarks Able Seaman Cargit. "Someone 'oo as read a sight too many books, I'm finking."

		RareDefaultEvent
Name: It's a cask of wine
Id: 145178
Description: In the flaring light, it's zee-dark, but the taste is the darkness of autumn. Mushroom wine. An acquired taste, perhaps, but once you've acquired it, who'd go back to grapes? Nasty little bubbles of goo, grapes.



		ChildBranches 2
Name: A bolt of fabric
Id: 122502
Description: Shake out a little and let it glimmer in the light.

		DefaultEvent
Name: Parabola-Linen
Id: 140910
Description: Parabola is the serpent-place behind mirrors. Or someone made that up. But in that case, where do they weave this sleek and ambery-glimmering cloth?

		RareDefaultEvent
Name: Spider-silk
Id: 145179
Description: You can find spider-silk in London, of course. There are troubles there with sorrow-spider infestation, like anywhere in the Neath. But for the real quality, you need to go east, to the Khanate, or to the fang-bristling fastness of Saviour's Rocks...



		ChildBranches 3
Name: An intriguingly lumpy sack
Id: 125254
Description: It's probably not a sack full of skulls.

		DefaultEvent
Name: Darkdrop Coffee
Id: 145180
Description: "We could run the boilers on this stuff," your second engineer remarks, "if'n we run out of coke." He sees your expression, and hastens to add, "We couldn't. We couldn't. Please don't put the coffee in the firebox, cap'n. It'd be a shocking waste."

		ParentEvent
Name: 
Id: 140906
Description: 

		RareDefaultEvent
Name: Souls
Id: 145181
Description: A sad little chain of bottled souls. It is hard to be sure if souls have eyes, but when these ones emerge from the sack into the light, they turn their blindly questing faces towards you in what seems like excitement - and then all at once relax. Disappointed, or relieved?



		ChildBranches 4
Name: A filthy scrap of paper
Id: 125255
Description: Creased and grimy

		DefaultEvent
Name: It's a page from a journal
Id: 145182
Description: "...until the sixth candle was extinguished. Now we all watched the flame as it stood up, as it were on tip-toe, taller and bluer each heart-beat. Its light grew brighter in the moments before it failed, so that I saw the faces of all my companions, drawn and white as if we were already dead. Then the candle-flame drew itself up like a dancer and was extinguished: dark fell upon us all like a wave, and I heard the hatchlings uncoil - "

Name: It's a page from a journal
Id: 145183
Description: "...on the day we saw the Pillars of Irem. They are not what I expected: Irem is the place one does not expect. That is its nature. You have seen it in your dreams. Yes, you, who found this page long after my death. I knew when I wrote these words that you would read them one day. Irem taught me this, and now Irem's lesson is all that remains of me."



		ChildBranches 5
Name: An oilskin packet
Id: 125256
Description: Something valuable, to someone.

		DefaultEvent
Name: An Unread Log
Id: 145184
Description: An odd, flat little stab-bound book, bound with red ribbon: but the cover reads LOG OF THE D______. Did some lost captain purchase it in the far bazaars of the Khanate?

		RareDefaultEvent
Name: Drowning-Pearls!
Id: 145185
Description: "The Fathomking spits these out," your bo'sun offers. "Coughs 'em up like a cat does a hairball." He catches your sceptical glance. "True as I'm here, captain. There's a fancy word for it and all. Nacribezoar, or I'm a lubber."
<br/><br/>
Whatever encyclopaedias the bo'sun has been drinking, these are drowning-pearls all right. They have the heft, the sheen, and the chill...



		ChildBranches 6
Name: A stout crate
Id: 125264
Description: Crates! The source of sustenance: the fundamental element of cargo.

		DefaultEvent
Name: A crate of fuel
Id: 145198
Description: Coke! Like coal, but more so, as the Department of Infernal Rarefactions would have it.

		ParentEvent
Name: 
Id: 140906
Description: 

		RareDefaultEvent
Name: A crate of supplies
Id: 145285
Description: Hardtack and water and an unexpected box of nails. A would-be wit remarks that the nails look tastier than the hardtack, until an officer's glare silences her.



		ChildBranches 7
Name: A rich wild scent
Id: 125316
Description: Whatever's in these barrels smells... heavenly.

		DefaultEvent
Name: Peaches!
Id: 145286
Description: Such peaches! Amber and dawn. A zeaman snaffles one, and is caught when the taste makes him burst into tears. Pack them carefully. Don't bruise them.

Description: 

		RareDefaultEvent
Name: Zzoup!
Id: 155898
Description: Glorious zzoup! The only fine thing ever to come from Mount Palmerston. Do devils make it, or dream it?



		ChildBranches 8
Name: A tightly-sealed crate
Id: 125317
Description: Is that the mark of the Iron Republic, Hell's client-state?

		DefaultEvent
Name: 
Id: 145287
Description: Waxy white lumps, sheened like paraffin. "Hell-droppings," the bo'sun opines. "Don't know what they're made of, but they'll burn long and steady. Better than coke, much."

		ParentEvent
Name: 
Id: 140906
Description: 

		RareDefaultEvent
Name: Candles!
Id: 155897
Description: What does Hell want with candles? Does it not have enough fires of its own? Was this from, or destined for, the Iron Republic? "Don't ask questions about devils," runs the proverb, "unless you want your soul ripped out by the roots and fed to goats." It's not much of a proverb, actually.



		ChildBranches 9
Name: A hessian bundle
Id: 125318
Description: It clinks.

		DefaultEvent
Name: A brass glove
Id: 145288
Description: Moulded flames adorn its fingertips and palms. It bears the inscription: HEAT TO INCANDESCENCE BEFORE USE. A devil's toy, certainly. An implement of torture, or a token of affection?

		ParentEvent
Name: 
Id: 140906
Description: 

		RareDefaultEvent
Name: A salt-glass
Id: 147921
Description: A narrow-waisted timer in a soapstone frame. The timer is filled with blue-white salt crystals. An inscription reads: IS IT TIME YET? From Whither, no doubt. They do enjoy their questions.



		ChildBranches 10
Name: A lacquered casket
Id: 125319
Description: It's the size of a small dog, or a large Bible. It's locked, but the lock won't resist a persistently-applied knife-blade, like this - 

		DefaultEvent
Name: A silver dagger
Id: 145289
Description: A leaf-bladed dagger? Or a long-handled mirror? Either way, it's deadly, and beautiful, edged with a rainbow of sharp and slender diamonds. Your reflection swims in it dimly. This two-natured thing must come from the many-natured city, farthest Irem...

		ParentEvent
Name: 
Id: 140906
Description: 

		RareDefaultEvent
Name: A many-rayed golden sun
Id: 147927
Description: A blandly smiling golden face. Rays extend from its edge, curled like leaves or tentacles. From the weight, it's real gold. A single spark crackles on its surface. "Dawn Machine's making," breathes the bo'sun; and the avarice in your crew's eyes curdles to wariness.



		ChildBranches 11
Name: An intriguingly lumpy sack
Id: 127014
Description: It's probably not a sack full of skulls.

		DefaultEvent
Name: Scintillack!
Id: 147912

		ParentEvent

Id: 140906
Description: 

		RareDefaultEvent

Id: 147913

		ChildBranches 12
Name: Signed and sealed
Id: 127020
Description: A brown paper package marked with a torn label. Once, perhaps, this was a delivery note.

		DefaultEvent
Name: Something barely shaped
Id: 147925
Description: A smoothed lump of bone, narrowed in the centre, bulging at the top. It looks unfinished, but it's traced with spidery lines. A map? A web? Or just something good to touch? Why are you so certain it's human bone?

		ParentEvent
Name: 
Id: 140906
Description: 

		RareDefaultEvent
Name: Something fragile
Id: 147926
Description: A porcelain ornament - a dog-faced lion or a lion-faced dog, scowling contemplatively from a careful bundle of silk wrappings. Creamy white, blushed with apple-green. Don't drop it.



		ChildBranches 13

Description: A big wicker basket, scrupulously sealed with black wax.

		DefaultEvent
Name: An Unclear Device!
Id: 154664
Description: Inside is a lead-lined casket. Wisps of smoky darkness escape it. 'Anarchist work,' the whisper goes up. They eat light, these things. They're useful in battle - but very far from safe.

		ParentEvent
Name: 
Id: 140906
Description: 

		RareDefaultEvent
Name: A Mirrorcatch Box!
Id: 177168
Description: Inside is an oak chest filled with a mind-twisting matrix of mirrors. Take it to the Surface, and perhaps you can bring sunlight down. But then what will you do with it? It's not permitted in London.
