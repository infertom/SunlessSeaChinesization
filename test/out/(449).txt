Name: Khan's Heart
Id: 143346
Description: Khan's Heart: London's rival. An oasis of light in the salt black wastes. Canals thread the painted city. Street-lamps glow and water-taxis putter.

Name: Seek a commercial license
Id: 124072
Description: The Khaganians dislike merchants, and they dislike foreigners. Foreign merchants induce paroxysms of antipathy. Perhaps sufficient bribes will buy your way into the Nephrite Quarter.

		DefaultEvent
Name: "Not here, Surfacer."
Id: 143347
Description: (Surfacer? But the Khaganians have been generations underground, and to them, all Londoners are Surfacers.) It seems you'll need to go to Khan's Glory, the nearby palaces of the nobility, to seek a license.

Id: 124073
Description: The Copper Quarter offers comfort to foreigners, but the prices are, to put it mildly, mischievous.

		DefaultEvent
Name: Solace
Id: 143348
Description: A gentle, trickling music plays behind screens of painted weed-wood. Khanate merchants sip tea and swap stories with darker-skinned Elder Continent captains. You sip pale golden tea and wince at the bill.

Name: A Shrine of the Deep Blue Heaven
Id: 154691
Description: Above, the roof of the Neath is black, impassive, prickled with false-stars: but the Khaganians still remember the sky. You pass an open-walled shrine with a domed roof - the interior is painted a deep pure indigo. Citizens kneel below it while a Blue Priest speaks. As he reaches the climax of his prayer, a rosy-golden light swells inside the dome. The worshippers murmur in complacent delight. The dome is now a perfect, heartbreaking, morning-sky blue, a colour you haven't seen for - how long?
<br/><br/>
"Filament-bulbs," your bo'sun whispers importantly beside you. "Give me honest gas-light any day."

Name: A song of the surface
Id: 154692
Description: Someone is singing in English! Something about a tree of wines and a stolen city, a sea of grass and a storm of bats... melancholy, pure and sweet, achingly familiar. You cross the street, cut back through an alleyway, trying to find it, but it ends before you get close. You find yourself humming it on the way back to the ship. Another zailor takes up the tune...

Name: Lost light
Id: 154749
Description: The canals of the Heart are lit by incandescent-filament lamps in bulbs of glass, in a multitude of colours. Ruby, sapphire, topaz, emerald by turns. There's nothing else like it in the Neath or on the surface. You spend a happy quarter-hour strolling the alleyways of the Copper Quarter, until an irritable workman sees you eyeing the bulbs and accuses you of plotting their theft.

Name: A relentless fishmonger
Id: 154693
Description: You are cornered by a screaming, cheerful woman in a sort of lacquer-armoured fish-suit. As far as you can make out, she was attacked in the Moon Canal by something with tentacles. She still has this tentacled thing, slung over her shoulder. For some reason she is determined that you should purchase it. You plead, evade, offer her nothing but the smallest coins - but she is relentless. Tentacles it is, then.

Name: A quiet street
Id: 154743
Description: A narrow street opens on your left. The filament-bulbs here are green-tinted, and the street is unusually dim, like the space between a thick forest canopy. Ten steps in, and the noise of the crowds on the canal-side is oddly hushed.

		DefaultEvent
Name: The rattle of coal
Id: 154709

Id: 131361
Description: Foreigners are permitted to buy food in the Copper Quarter, but only poor quality in small quantities. And so you go from street-vendor to street-vendor, trying to purchase enough soggy smoked fish to feed your crew.

		DefaultEvent
Name: Smirking Khaganians
Id: 154741
Description: They watch you carry armfuls of brown paper packages past the canals back to your ship. They know you're skirting the edge of the law: either they don't care enough to stop you, or they're having too much fun watching you carry all that smoked fish.

		DefaultEvent
Name: The Temptations of Parabola
Id: 154798
Description: ...where London now stands, the capital of the Khanate once stood, after its own disappearance from the surface. After the clean sky and wide earth they went half-mad in the close night under the Earth. They found serpent-things in mirrors that promised them diversion, escape, new horizons. In time the mirror-serpents became masters, not servants, and the last True Khan led the last of his people to the Salt Steppes, to a black rock where he founded this city. How he built it is a tale for another day...

Description: ...the last Great Khan of the Surface was corrupt and foolish and cowardly. (How fortunate we are that the Leopard Clan overthrew his line - long may the Leopard endure!) He sold the Khanate's capital to the Masters of the Bazaar to satisfy his greed and escape battle. So Karakorum fell - so it came below the earth, to the long night of the Neath. Seven hundred years ago, Karakorum stood where London now stands...

Description: You show the talisman rather cautiously to a clutch of captains chatting by their warship. One grabs it cheerfully and claps you on the shoulder. "I've heard about you! Come on. I'm buying." With more friendliness than Khaganians usualy show, they drag you off to a little place by the park and fill you with rare spiced seaweed and Elder Continent wines. They grumble about Chelonate delinquency, the 'idiot children' of Khan's Shadow, and - until they remember you're there - the London captains cluttering up the clean zee...

They menace citizens after dark with their sinister poetry. They steal dogs and house-bats and the occasional baby. Trade, prosperity and security suffer outrageously. The White-and-Golds ask their questions and compile their careful records. They note the report that your ship was among those that visited just before the infestation began. It isn't proof of your involvement: but there is a little mark beside your name on a little list.
