Name: A moment's reflection
Id: 138605
Description: The Former Captain of the Nocturne sits in his one-time cabin, remembering the taste of mushroom wine.

		DefaultEvent
Name: His body is broken, but his mind remains sharp
Id: 167691
Description: For now, at least. Wrapped in fresh bandages to cover his hollow eyes and his borrowed clothes hanging off his emaciated arms, he looks like the kind of corpse even a tomb colonist would think twice to be seen with. Being in his old cabin however does appear to be soothing what pain the wine cannot. He will be ready, if trouble strikes.

Description: Wrapped in fresh bandages to cover his hollow eyes and with borrowed clothes hanging off his emaciated arms, he looks like the kind of corpse even a tomb colonist would think twice to be seen with.

Name: All is quiet
Id: 167745
Description: Just the friendly lingering terror of the zee. Occasionally, a half-heard echo of somebody else's problems far away. A few relaxing moments to savour.
