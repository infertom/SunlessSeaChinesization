		DefaultEvent
Name: A long afternoon
Id: 143359
Description: You meet with an Effusive Official in a room of blue glass and pierced porcelain. You supply the customary compliments and courtesies, while he nods complacently. Finally you present a sample of the coffee. The Official comes suddenly awake, inhales the scent of the coffee, glances regretfully at the porcelain screen behind him - a watcher? He bows to you three times and sends you on your way.

Description: The Effusive Official is today attended by three servants and a Blue Priest, each carrying a candle of a different colour. He speaks a formula in Khaganian, in Greek, and in one of the languages of the Elder Continent. You are anointed with oils and presented with a pair of sharkskin gloves. The Blue Priest admits you to a slightly less debased echelon of foreignness, and blesses you in the name of the Deep Blue Heaven.

After that, you start filling in forms...

Name: Tea and confusion
Id: 154820
Description: The Effusive Official sips tea while you run through the polite forms of request. You're not sure he's listening. "Absolutely!" he splutters suddenly. He hands you a form for - as far as you can make out - a request for a fisherman's license. You explain, patiently, again. He nods apologetically and gives you a second copy of the same form: but this time, he writes your name carefully in the Roman, not the Khaganian, alphabet.
<br/><br/>
You hand the form back, very politely.
<br/><br/>
On the fourth explanation, you begin to make progress...

You have the impression that she doesn't particularly like traitors, even useful ones.
