Id: 152141
Description: The informers of the Copper Quarter by the Docks peddle knowledge from all over the Unterzee. The only things they won't sell are their real names. One who calls herself the Bright Bird introduces you, and the Magician, to a wizened man in bright spider-silk - a collector of looking-glasses. The Magician and the Collector mutter together for a while: the Collector wheezes with laughter. 
<br/><br>
At last the Magician returns, eyes bright. "All shall be well," he says, "and all manner of thing shall be well. I know where to go, now. I know what to do. Thank you, my friend. My revenge is almost within my grasp." He looks ruefully at his hook.
