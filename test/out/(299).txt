Name: A Candle-Lit Shop
Id: 154987
Description: A quiet street washed with serpent-green light from bulbs overhead. The houses here are dark, empty-seeming. Paint peels and bats chitter. A single shop, however, is open. Its windows glow with candle-light. The shopkeeper is a tall woman with pale eyes - not a local, but not a Londoner either. She blows the dust off a baize box and smiles toothily at you.

Name: A misplaced delivery?
Id: 154992
Description: The shopkeeper opens a trap-door. A pale and surly youth comes up, blinking, and hastily dons a pair of dark glasses. He helps you carry the Long-Box down to the dock, mute all the way.

		DefaultEvent
Name: She shakes her head sadly.
Id: 154993
Description: "Oh, no. No no. Mirrors are unloved here in the Khanate, you see. I can only suspect you of being a spy for the White-and-Golds. If I even had such a mirror, I could not sell it; and were you not a spy, still I would not damn you with its seductions. Perhaps there is something else?"
