Description: Make the pass-sign to a Mute Exile.

		DefaultEvent
Name: Nod, nod, shrug
Id: 153216
Description: She hands you an oilskin pouch. Nine foolscap sheets of beautifully written cipher, gathered from who knows what corners of the Unterzee. You look up: she points across the water towards the distant lights of Whither town. She shakes her head. No home there for her, not now. She points to your ship, and raises her eyebrows.

Description: How do blemmigans deal with the cold?

		DefaultEvent
Name: Not well
Id: 158887
Description: It scurries desperately back up the gang-plank, shrilling pathetically. Not a fan of ice, apparently.

Id: 144275
Description: This one has waited all her life for a single answer. Give her that answer, and she will be ready to lay down her life.

		DefaultEvent
Name: A cracked voice
Id: 177004
Description: "Thank you! Thank you. This is what I needed. This is enough."
<br/>
She coughs rackingly. "I've waited so long to speak, and now - now I have nothing at all to say. Quickly, then. Find me my death."

Name: Allow your Navigator to join the Mute Exiles
Id: 147450
Description: The stones of Codex crawl with sigils. Your Navigator steps into the enfolding silence of the glum, grey shore. His tattoo shivers like a nestling gull.

		DefaultEvent
Name: Goodbye
Id: 182213
Description: One of the Mute Exiles brings him a loaf of brown algae-bread. Another gives him a chipped jug of water. The Navigator does not thank you or say goodbye. From the moment he sets foot on the isle, he does not speak at all. But he takes your hand in his, briefly, before turning to the Exiles' cave.
<br/><br/>
As you leave, one of the Exiles tugs at your sleeve. He leads you to an unmarked stone the size of a church Bible, produces a chisel and hammer from his robe, and strikes the stone three times. It splits in half. Inside, a sigil the colour of quartz glistens, trapped in the stone like a fossil. The Exile gestures at you to take it.

Id: 147629
Description: No one will speak. This is a challenge.

		DefaultEvent
Name: Silently forthright
Id: 182474
Description: The exiles see many come, fewer leave. Some are even willing to communicate - but their gestures are unfamiliar, the meanings unclear. Even when you can understand, these are answers without questions, as useless as a key without a lock.
