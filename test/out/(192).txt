Id: 148072
Description: "These are the younger form of gargantuan zee-crabs - driven up from their spawning grounds in the south by peculiar radiations. Younger they may be, but they are still large enough to consume a pony with messy and clattering glee, or to pose a menace to ill-prepared ships."
