Name: Demand an explanation
Id: 146372
Description: The question is a single word: Why?

		DefaultEvent
Name: An impersonal betrayal
Id: 180537
Description: "Why would a man throw a life-preserver to a drowning child?" The Determined Doctor looks up, revolutionary fervour in his eye. "You were not <i>there,</i> [q:Addressed As], or you would know! Our only salvation is in anarchy... in burning London, bringing down the Khanate, in sealing the Cumaean Canal! Taking back <i>what is ours!"</i>
<br /><br />
"They understand that. In the Shadow, they understand."

Name: Argue with the Determined Doctor
Id: 146376
Description: Good grief. Has this man ever found a cause he didn't immediately embrace?

		DefaultEvent
Name: It is a question worth asking
Id: 180544
Description: For a moment, it is as if you have gotten through to him. But no. A man who would fall so quickly from worshipping sorrow-spiders into the crooked clutches of the Calendar Council, and still be instantly won over by a bunch of Khaganian anarchs... is a man with an impenetrable shield of homilies and self-justification.
<br /><br />
"I did what I must," says the Doctor, his solitary eye staring past your ear. "I could have done no less."

		DefaultEvent
Name: A principled stand
Id: 180545
Description: "Please understand, there was no pleasure or satisfaction in what I did. It was only with the bitterest regret and for the greatest good that I betrayed your trust."
<br /><br />
"But I cannot swear that, [q:Addressed As]. I must continue to act as my conscience demands, as must you with yours. I will speak no false promises to spare my neck."

Name: The Doctor returns to work
Id: 146379
Description: Under guard, of course. He is, fortunately or not, too good a surgeon to simply discard.

		DefaultEvent
Name: It does not seem much of a punishment
Id: 180547
Description: Still, the Doctor's face sinks into gloom. Was he hoping to be a martyr for his latest cause? Is he simply sick that he will be unable to help his anarch friends?
<br /><br />
It matters not. The irons around his wrists are removed. He is free to resume his duties, at least for the moment.
