Name: The Salt Lions, after
Id: 175523
Description: Two basalt beasts, cathedral-sized. They frown eternally at each other across the black waves. The north one carries the remnants of an encampment, fraying and tattering in the wind. A supply dock stands empty below.

Name: Pick over the encampment
Id: 143316
Description: From time to time, some entrepreneur attempts to continue the disassembly of the Salt Lions. It never ends well. But perhaps they've left something.

		DefaultEvent
Name: Nothing
Id: 175525
Description: A steady breeze blows from the North: ozone and ice. The false-stars prickle above. The Salt Lions wait for their end.

Description: A barrel of Murgatroyd's Fungal Crackers. A sack of coke. A tear-stained Bible. An odd slick of blood. Take what you can, and leave.

Name: Salt's Rites
Id: 143317
Description: The face of the northern sphinx is all but gone. Lost faces are sacred to Salt, they say. You are drawn there. To what end? Salt's voice is distant, but clear...

		DefaultEvent
Name: Into the zee
Id: 175526
Description: Dive from the sphinx's face, down, a clean arc into the zee's chilly darkness. Float there in the quiet, until your lungs are bursting, until light blooms behind your eyes. Rise gasping to the prickle of false-stars, the shocked faces of your crew. You've brought something with you.

Id: 143321
Description: You've brought the Nacreous Outcast here. With luck, it knows why.

		DefaultEvent
Name: Unexpected grace
Id: 175530
Description: The face of the northern sphinx is all but gone, but the Nacreous Outcast scrambles doggedly up. It pauses at the top, and then flips into the air - an arc as precise as a compass-line, down into the darkness of the zee. It's gone with barely a splash.
<br/><br/>
You wait. There is no reason for alarm. It can probably breathe water. You wait longer. There is a certain degree of decorous alarm. Longer still, and the alarm manifests in the form of zailors clustering casually by the rail - only casually, because no one would admit any concern for the fate of a Rubbery Man.
<br/><br/>
The Rubbery Man surfaces! It mounts the steps to the quay, with the ceremonious delight of a vicar mounting the steps to a pulpit. It holds a sphinxstone chess-piece aloft in its hand... "Principles," it wheezes.

Name: Moist wide eyes
Id: 175531
Description: "Shaltsh Ftentshion," it insists. "Godshly!" It gestures at the face of the northern sphinx. It brandishes the cruet. [You'll need Salt's Attention to continue. You can gain it in Whither, among other places.]

Name: Put a blemmigan ashore
Id: 147302
Description: The island isn't entirely sheer rock. Just mostly. Blemmigans have populated harsher environments.

		DefaultEvent
Name: Scenting something familiar?
Id: 181987
Description: The blemmigan scales the face of the north lion, squeezing fine tendrils into the narrowest of cracks, pressing on to the Unmakers' abandoned encampment. You leave it groping blindly at the laces of a tent, twittering softly.
