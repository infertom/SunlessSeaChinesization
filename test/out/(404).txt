Name: The Lady's Patronage
Id: 169232
Description: "We have not met. Have we? No, this is definitely the first time. But - hmm." The Lady of the Cages shakes her head sharply. "Best to proceed as if it is the first, don't you think?"
<br><br>
A veil of gold-mesh obscures only her eyes, leaving her glistening, bitten lips bare. Perhaps a hundred small silver keys jangle in a bunch at her left hip. "I think we should be friends. I'm very important you know - or I was. No, still am." She pauses. "Yes, I am quite sure I still am."

Description: "You should come back last Tuesday for another little chat," she pauses, and huffs. "No, that's not quite it. Ahem. Come back - soon? Another time. Pick a good one. There aren't enough of those." 
<br><br>
That was - probably? - a dismissal.

Description: "You know Isery? What a lovely coincidence, I know them quite well myself."

		DefaultEvent
Name: 
Id: 169234
Description: She does not seem to mind your previous failures. "Pasts are tricky things. I find it's best to ignore them, on the whole. I think we're much more suited to be friends, don't you?"

Name: Refuse her
Id: 139463
Description: You are quite busy at the moment, and possibly your grandmother is ill.

		DefaultEvent
Name: 
Id: 169235
Description: Zaira takes your refusal in stride. "Maybe you'll rethink things, once your grandmother is feeling recovered. Is it sciatica? Or fluke-flu? Both? You don't say. My sympathies."

Id: 169236
Description: "Are you <em>quite</em> sure you're working for Isery, and not for me?" Zaira wrinkles her nose. "How extraordinary. Oh well - another time. Another city. Probably? Quite."

Name: Second chances
Id: 140689
Description: You have failed them before. But perhaps they are feeling lenient?

		DefaultEvent
Name: 
Id: 171289
Description: "We've already tried to be friends once, haven't we? I hardly think we should attempt it again. I might actually have you eaten by a Drownie." A flash of white teeth. "Or maybe Isery's the one that has people eaten by Drownies? Maybe we both do? Does that seem likely to you?" 
[The Patrons of the Isle of Cats have no further use for you.]
