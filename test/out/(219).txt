Name: The Export in Darkness
Id: 149012
Description: Candlelight warms this corner of the building. The Austere Acolyte has pushed her goggles away from her face, and has set out a light meal. A bottle of Greyfields 1882 is open to breathe.
<br/>
<br/>
It is the most comfortable you have seen her yet.

Name: Small talk
Id: 149017
Description: You change the subject to lighter matters, and keep her company with the stories of other ports you've visited, and the creatures you've seen moving in the deep.
<br/>
<br/>

		DefaultEvent
Name: No comment
Id: 149013

Name: Reasons
Id: 149014
Description: She looks away from you, into the glass of mushroom wine.
<br/>
<br/>
"There's a story I heard when I first apprenticed here," she says. "That there was someone who worked here who swallowed one of the black pellets, and it made them impervious to grief. There was nothing they could see that was worse than what they already knew."
<br/>
<br/>
She pours some of the wine out for you. "I think that would be a great strength to have, don't you?"

		DefaultEvent
Name: A miss
Id: 149015
Description: She frowns and gets up, instantly suspicious.
<br/>
<br/>
"What have you really come for?" she demands.

		SuccessEvent
Name: First times for everything
Id: 149016
Description: She smiles; she lowers her eyes; she is obviously not surprised. The environment is perhaps not very comfortable for this sort of thing, but you make do.
<br/>
<br/>
Later, much later, when you hear her singing at her work again, it's all about a wax shepherdess melting in the fields, and the humid kiss of a steam locomotive. You choose to see this as a compliment.
