His eyes are wide and dark. His voice is low. These things he speaks of - the disposition of darkness, the shadows of land, the path the quiet wind walks - these were laws once. But here, so far from the Sun, the laws have decayed. Their force is spent. This is why the zee changes eternally, like a sleeper twisting in dreams. At least, now, you understand a little of how it might change.
