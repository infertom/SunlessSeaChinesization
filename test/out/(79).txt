Name: An Evening with the Delightful Adventuress
Id: 143651
Description: Whoever she is, she knows how to pack a hall. Not a seat is empty as she takes the stage.

		DefaultEvent
Name: "The fine cuisine of the Chelonate! The darling Clay Men! All but a prelude, my dears..."
Id: 176038
Description: Her stories tend towards the fanciful and conveniently unprovable, but the Delightful Adventuress has the credulous audience spellbound for hours.
<br /><br />
Many of her tales of monsters and lost cities have a common theme. She visited them ahead of a certain Lady Leonora Fortescue, the quite <i>adorable</i> Daring Archeologist with whom she sparked a bracing rivalry back at finishing school. The rest are tales, bitter as the sourest grapes, of being cheated of triumphs by the very same Fortescue, whose fanciful fictions are fit only for the penny dreadfuls!
<br /><br />
By the end, her stories are notably more bitter than boastful. She still receives a standing ovation.

Name: "Ah, my dear kapitano!"
Id: 176464
Description: Firelight glints in her eyes as she raises the glass. "I hear you are recently returned from the Empire of... oh, Monkeys? <i>Hands.</i> Yes, of course. It is a rare breed that can make such a voyage. Foolhardy too, perhaps."
<br /><br />
She sips her brandy. "I wish to charter your no doubt fine vessel to that primitive little island chain. There, I shall find what I need to show up the infernal Leonora Fortescue once and for all, and you..." <br /><br />The Delightful Adventuress squints, sizing you up. "Sufficient compensation will not be a difficulty. A most mutually beneficial arrangement, you will agree."
