Name: A sense of apathy prevails
Id: 167638
Description: "Indeed, a splendid prize, I have no doubt," says the Emissary of Spiders, handing it off to a Widow without even breaking open the pages. "But what of the ship? Did you encounter any... resistance?"

Name: The unseeing eye in the dark
Id: 138618
Description: You were watched. It can not have been a coincidence.

		DefaultEvent
Name: The spider-council chitters with excitement
Id: 167719
Description: "Yes. Yes, I fear that we have not been strictly honest in our dealings," the Emissary of Spiders says, with no hint of guilt or remorse, or even a sense that this should come as a surprise.
<br /><br />
"Permit me to... share a story. It was, I believe, a century ago that the myopic masters forged a deal with a great beast, an Avaricious Lorn-Fluke. It would provide..." He pauses at the stern bite of a sorrow-spider... "A service, yes. In exchange, secrets. One hundred years of the secrets its service would allow to be harvested."
<br /><br />
He leans in. "For the sake of all that is and all that is to come, some secrets can never be shared."

Id: 167720
Description: "How curious." The Emissary of Spiders is silent for a moment, listening to his masters. He nods. "I fear to tell you that I may have not been entirely honest in our dealings thus far."

Name: A secret that worries even the sorrow-spiders?
Id: 138620
Description: You're getting out of your depth now.

		DefaultEvent
Name: An abandoned vessel. An abandoned secret.
Id: 167721
Description: Does this mean the sorrow-spiders discovered something so terrible, or so important, that they decided not even they should know it? That seems most out of character. Unless they were simply waiting until their deal expired to stake a claim...
<br /><br />
"I can neither confirm, nor deny, of course," says the Emissary of Spiders. "What matters at this present juncture is the vessel. It must be removed from the geometry, and the reach of the unworthy. The intractable masters demand this be done."

Name: An angry chattering fills the air
Id: 167723
Description: The Emissary of Spiders silences the chattering with a weary wave. "Our enemies will already consider you their enemy, too. I suggest you make the best of the situation. Lorn-Flukes are not famed for their forgiving nature. But it will be as you wish." [You can continue or ignore the spiders' mission, as you prefer.]
