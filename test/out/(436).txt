Id: 175587
Description: In better times, being overseer of Port Stanton gave the incumbent their pick of visitors to the Empire. Now, it is as thankless a task as any to be found in the Neath.

Name: Sell your soul to the Mayor
Id: 143363
Description: He doesn't have much to offer, but if you aren't using it...
<br />
[The Mayor will pay 200 Echoes for your soul.]

Name: The deal is struck!
Id: 175588
Description: There is an official Chandler of Souls who would ordinarily preside over such things, but the Mayor sees no reason why he should receive his customary fee for something that any monkey with a blackjack and a few implements can do. Even an unsouled forest-monkey can steal a soul and almost never cause lasting harm to the victim. Donor. He means donor. Of course.

Later, you awaken under rags, bruised, with a headache and feeling of loss. It is done. Your mind licks at the strange emptiness as a tongue might a missing tooth.

Name: Acquire emergency fuel
Id: 143374
Description: If only there wasn't a trade embargo, you could refuel so cheaply and easily, the Mayor sighs. "Oh, if only!" But, he adds, idly picking his teeth, he might, just maybe, know of some barrels conveniently sitting around...
<br />
[This fuel will cost a pricey 50 Echoes per barrel]

		DefaultEvent
Name: The deal has been done
Id: 175603
Description: His prices are extortionate, of course. Still, poverty is a better option than being stranded. Hopefully this will be enough to make it to a port where the vendors don't literally lick their lips as they count your money.

Name: Acquire emergency fuel
Id: 143385
Description: The Mayor smiles, steepling his fingers. The zailor in him knows he has you over a barrel, and that barrel contains fuel. The Delightful Adventuress in him concurs.
<br />
[This fuel will cost a ludicrous 75 Echoes per barrel]

		DefaultEvent
Name: Merely Echoes? No blood for good measure?
Id: 175616
Description: It is not that monkeys have no word for gratitude, simply that in most tongues it translates as an obscenity. But you had no choice. Perhaps a nostalgic part of the soul within him feels bad about this. Probably not.

Id: 143386
Description: The Mayor smiles tightly. As a four-soul ape with ambitions, he cannot be seen to be anything but cunning, ruthless, and avaricious to a fault. The part of him that was the Delightful Adventuress only cheers him on.

<br />
[This fuel will cost a hefty 40 Echoes per barrel]

		DefaultEvent
Name: The deal has been done
Id: 175618
Description: The Flea-Ridden Mayor snatches the extortionate fee, toying with it in the candlelight. He nods. "Will send. No questions. More if needed."
