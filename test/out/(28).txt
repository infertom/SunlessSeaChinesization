Name: A dream of sand
Id: 146622
Description: The ship crosses a desert, not a zee. Black sand whispers against the hull - sand like grains of glittering night. Your crew sit on deck at a long table lined with candles, eating a rich red feast. "A reckoning," one remarks, as she spears a gobbet of meat with her fork, "is not to be postponed indefinitely."

Name: A dream of spires
Id: 146624
Description: Mirror-faceted pillars rise around you like trees in a forest - more so, because each glows with a shifting green light. The zee laps at the base of the pillars. A voice from above cries out in seven languages, and you understand each one: "Once was this the face of Irem! It will be taken from us!"

His fellows cry out in envy and greed. They fall on him, and there comes a great rending of white petals. More petals fall, obscuring the masts, the ship, the Neath, the false-stars of the roof. It is very cold. You will have to set a fire -

Id: 146626
Description: You walk through streets of buildings trapped in amber, flooded with treacly light. Rubbery Men, their face-tentacles twitching complacently, swirl around you in crowds. They give you a wide berth: something drips from your hands. Not blood. It's pale as milk. A bell tolls. You turn in through an ornate arch, and all the lights go out - but not before you see the spined shape throned in a pool at the chamber's heart.
