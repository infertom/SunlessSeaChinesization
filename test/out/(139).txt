Name: The Tomb-Colony of Venderbight
Id: 141878
Description: On deck, you can hear the sound that a thousand bandaged dead make as they shuffle and cough. It's something like the world's most restless concert audience, or the world's most plague-ridden cathedral.

Id: 124451
Description: ZEE-CAPTAINS: THE FIRST CURATOR GIVES AUDIENCE. The First Curator is responsible for the preservation of the tomb-colonies. It has been here much longer than London, like all the oldest tomb-colonists. But even tomb-colonists dissolve in the end. Its time is close.

Name: A dusty glass of wine
Id: 124452
Description: Venderbight is not the most promising place for shore leave. Too much decay. Too little light. Too many bandaged walking corpses. Few companions of easy virtue. No cinnamon, no recent newspapers, very little pickled cave-herring.

Id: 149332
Description: Along the coasts of the Unterzee, it's remarkably hard to die. The decrepit and nearly-dead who leave London become tomb-colonists, and settle here in bandaged peace.
<br/><br/>But they don't give up their ties to home, or their politics. You gather a haul of complex clues - enough to keep your contacts in London interested.

Name: Remnants
Id: 152777
Description: In an wide space behind the Hollow Temple, you happen across a stepped platform of sorts. Four statues guard it, marked with glyphs all but lost to time and idle vandalism. They look a little like the glyphs that decorate the Echo Bazaar in London, though...
<br/><br/> At the heart of the platform is a long-filled well-shaft, too. You poke about briefly, but something in the place makes you uneasy. A frost-moth - the size of a farmer's hand - flutters down to perch on the well's edge. Another. A third. You retreat...

Description: You pause for refreshment at the Hungarian Cafe. The coffee is dusty, and the pastries a little stale, but the gaggle of decaying violin-players are skilled and surprisingly sprightly. They play "Eat Our Hearts, My Darling", "The King is Tall, Tall", and "Pop Goes the Weasel", with brio and conviction. Then they start on "The Old Dark Ocean Under the World", and you realise the time. Your ship awaits you...

		DefaultEvent
Name: A withered garden
Id: 152779
Description: Dead fir-trees have carpeted a little park with old brown needles. A little group of tomb-colonists stands around another lying on a bench. Unexpectedly, you find yourself reminded of physicians and midwifes at a birthing-couch. The colonist on the bench - he's old, withered to sticks - groans horribly, though the fir-needles deaden the sound. Something moves in his chest, like a sea-creature surfacing, or a butterfly breaching a cocoon. 
<br/><br/>
The other colonists spot you, and close ranks around him. "Stay back, silkskin," one hisses. "This is <i>his</i> breaking-out. Your time will come..." There is a kind of rapture in her voice.

"Yes," she says, proudly displaying her missing arm, "we render ourselves to good end. Oh, don't look like that. Our fats are of a finer quality than any other, and we grow tired of our bodies, down here - "

Name: An attack!
Id: 152782
Description: You round a darkened corner and start down a broad boulevard lined with grimacing statues. There is a fluttering movement above, and a cloud of frost-moths swoops down upon you! You beat them off with your walking-stick - they are determined, and the largest are the size of zee-bats, but they are fragile. At last they retreat, leaving three of their number melting into water on the pavement. Their wings are marked with patterns that resemble letters. You peer at them, but the script is already dissolving...

Nothing eventful, only eery. But when you return to the quayside, someone has left an odd, bulky box for you. There is no bill of lading, but the name of your ship is attached to a tag.

She draws a sword from her sash. You jump back. Tomb-colonists, fearless and long-experienced, are famed for their duelling skills. She raises the sword, flourishes it, and beheads herself with a triumphant cry. Her head bounces across the ground towards you.
