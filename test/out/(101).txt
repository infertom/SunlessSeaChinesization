Name: "A light in farthest dar-kness..."
Id: 172909
Description: It's a cheaply printed, badly written, painfully catchy popular song. But it has your name in it! Your deeds for Empire, secret or not, have won glory for London - and won you glory with it. The Navy's reputation is a little less tarnished. The parks of London, a little less dank. The seas, a little safer. Over the next few days, your hall is crammed with gifts from admirers.
