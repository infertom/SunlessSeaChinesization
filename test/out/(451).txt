Name: Khan's Shadow
Id: 152332
Description: Long ago, the Khanate turned its back on its warrior traditions. It has no place for pirates and would-be nomads: so here, in the Shadow, the exiles make their home, amid a hundred wrecked, grounded, decommissioned ships.

Name: Acquire a Doomed Monster-Hunter
Id: 144273

Name: Peligin eyes
Id: 177002
Description: He tugs at the brim of his dripping hat. His eyes are the colour of the deepest zee. "I'm ready," he tells you. "No, I need no food. No water. I will feed myself from the zee."

Name: A gathering of anarchists
Id: 146368
Description: That is nothing unusual here, of course. Most nights, half the Shadow hatches plots over cheap wine and old insults. But who is that Officer in the crowd?

		DefaultEvent
Name: The usual diatribes
Id: 180530
Description: The Haunted Doctor stands listening in rapt attention, his remaining eye closed. On a stage made from tables and upturned chairs, an attractive young man and woman take turns raging against injustice and talking of the glorious day when London and the Khanate and all others who dare to elevate themselves above others will face their reckoning. (The irony is, as ever, lost.)
<br /><br />
Once the meeting ends he hurries over to thank you, glowing with second-hand fervour.
<br /><br />
"I have... missed this," says the Doctor, something strange taking over his face. If you didn't know better, you'd say it was a <i>smile.</i> He heads over to the young woman to try it out, renewed purpose in his stride.

Name: Let your Longshanks Gunner go ashore
Id: 146434
Description: "I'm no more good to yer, Captain. I've got the scent o' freedom, now, and I'm for the city of broken ships."

		DefaultEvent
Name: A profitable parting
Id: 180642
Description: "So I've got a confession to make. I've been moonlighting in the old trade. Not aboard ship. I'd never steal from a shipmate, cap'n, I zwear!" She winks. "But a port here, a port there. Here's some of my haul, and thanks."
<br/><br/>
She hands you a collection of clinking objects wrapped in cloth, shoulders a bundle, and, whistling, hurdles the rail to land in a rusting coal-barge. She's gone.

		DefaultEvent
Name: A knack for concealment
Id: 181959
Description: The blemmigan disappears into the moist shadows of a nearby wreck. A Shadow watches it go. "Mushrooms," she says cheerfully. "I've missed mushrooms."

		DefaultEvent
Name: Closely-written notes
Id: 182503
Description: Conniving, debauching, speechifying, drinking, singing, speeching, poeting. Now and then a drunken duel. Very occasionally, a savage ritual murder.

Name: Sell an exotic weapon to Shadow buccaneers
Id: 129827
Description: "Icarus in Black! The masterwork of an Iron Republic Artificer. Captains fear it. Monsters flee it!" [A Hearts success will get you a slightly better price.]

		DefaultEvent
Name: A fair price
Id: 152336
Description: The Icarus is an eccentric weapon, and the Scarred Buccaneer who purchases it may not find success in piracy. But she seems content enough.

Name: An excellent price!
Id: 152337
Description: The Icarus is an eccentric weapon. The Scarred Buccaneer who purchases it may not find it very much use against the Khanate Navy. But she purrs with delight: it's a trophy to inspire envy in rival buccaneers!

Name: Help Maybe's Daughter search for her mother
Id: 146187
Description: "She was a spy, once, I think. I think she might still be one. Well, a lot of us are. Freelancers, anyway. Look, perhaps you shouldn't say that to anyone at the Admiralty. I do talk nonsense when I'm nervous."

		DefaultEvent
Name: "No luck."
Id: 180247
Description: "She murdered a White-and-Gold here last month. Or someone else in lilac did. It's an unlucky colour here, I think. But let me tell you something else I heard. And then we can look elsewhere. We'll find her."

Name: "She was here last week, but - "
Id: 180248
Description: You follow the Daughter's stunned gaze. A woman in a lilac gown leans in the doorway of a tea-shop. Her features bear an unmistakable resemblance to your officer's. "We should talk," she says to the Daughter, quite calmly.
<br/><br/>
The Daughter assembles the rags of her composure with remarkable speed. "Excuse us," she says...
