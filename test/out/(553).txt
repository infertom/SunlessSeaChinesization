Name: Aestival
Id: 143322
Description: Sun! A great beam of sunlight bathes the island! Squint into the dazzle: far above, there's a hole in the roof.
<br/><br/>
In that light you see beaches of white-gold sand; trees heavy with bright fruit; the reds and blues and greens of the Surface.

Name: Seek the Iron & Misery company prototype component
Id: 124056
Description: The Cannoneer points. "There. The black rocks on the south side of the island, where nothing grows. We'll need labour and supplies to dig it out." [This will consume the Supplies, but not the Crew.]

		DefaultEvent
Name: Aestival's Secret
Id: 143323
Description: Days of back-breaking labour unearth a cache of old bones, curios... and a meteorite. A broken armature of steel and copper sheathes its sides. The zailors fall back before it as the glyphs on its side crawl with fire.
<br/><br/>
"This is it!!" the Cannoneer cries. "This must be what broke the roof. (It's very frightening.) A Seal of the Red Science!! I never thought I'd see such a thing. But it's sleeping. We'll need a Judgement's Egg, and my friends in the Iron Republic. We might be able to find an Egg in Irem." (The crew shrink back a little.) "Oh, such larks. Such larks!!"
<br/><br/>
[Take the Seal, and a Judgements' Egg, to the Iron Republic, south of London.]

Name: Investigate the ruins
Id: 124057
Description: There was some sort of installation here - and what looks like a handsome country house. Who was here? And what happened to them? [This will open on Thursday 19th February.]

		DefaultEvent
Name: Red bird singing
Id: 143324
Description: A garden overgrown with berry-bushes. A wooden trestle-table, set for a meal. Chairs strewn with bones - a half-dozen skeletons. A red-breasted bird perches on a grinning cranium. It cocks an eye at you, and bursts into song: a liquid, thrilling sound. It seems unperturbed as you approach to poke through the bones.
<br/><br/>
No signs of violence. No fire, no bullets, no bites. These people died peacefully, sitting down to breakfast, as the Surface sunlight spilled over them. Sunlight can kill at any time. The longer you remain here, the more danger you're in. So why did they stay?
<br/><br/>
Perhaps they stayed because Aestival is as beautiful as anywhere in the Neath, and ten times as generous. It's a fine place for a colony. You could found your own pocket kingdom... if you could do something about the sun. But what? What has power over sunlight? What makes the impossible, possible?

Name: Mortal measures
Id: 181050
Description: You fill the box successfully... but the sunlight has lit a fire in your bones. You struggle back to the ship and wait while the fever subsides. Be wary. This is true sunlight, and it can be unpredictable death to those who've spent too long here below.

		DefaultEvent
Name: Exotic delights
Id: 181048
Description: Breadfruit, sugar-cane, coconut. Soft-shelled crabs and plump birds too stupid to know a hungry zailor from a tree. Aestival is ripe with treasures unknown in the Neath. Fill your hold.

Name: Rare Default!
Id: 181049
Description: You fill your stores with breadfruit, sugar-cane, coconut. Soft-shelled crabs and plump birds too stupid to know a hungry zailor from a tree. But on the way back to the ship, one of your crew topples over with a groan. She's smiling blissfully. "Go on, cap'n," she says. "I've missed the zun." Her eyes close. Sunlight is perilous for those who've lived in the Neath too long.

Name: Put a blemmigan ashore
Id: 147271
Description: Fallen fruit enriches the soil. Perhaps this will give the timid mushroom strength to resist the sun's rays.

		DefaultEvent
Name: A nimble scuttle
Id: 181946
Description: It bounces swiftly across the sun-hot sand, using a minimum of tendrils on the scorching beach. Somewhat shrivelled, it snuggles into the shade of a fruit-rich tree. It seems unwilling to go further.
