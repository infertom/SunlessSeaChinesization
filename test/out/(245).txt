Description: Play, that eye-roll says. Play. I played once, in the happy warrens of London, before you installed me in this floating coffin and made me eat dried food. Damn your play. It is an eloquent eye-roll.

Name: A conspiracy with the cook
Id: 150244
Description: Your Ferret goes uncomplainingly to the pot. It's nice to think that even at the end, it served loyally: but you suspect it simply can't be bothered to complain. It barely takes the edge off your hunger, but every little helps.

Name: A single circuit
Id: 155803
Description: The Ferret rises from its pillow and moves to explore the cabin! It moves like a meandering stream of treacle. It noses at furniture, disdains boots. It returns to its pillow. There is nothing, its expression says - nothing at all - nothing for me here.

Description: The Ferret raises its head and snaps at your hand. It moves so slowly that you cannot imagine it hoped to bite you properly. It sets its head at an angle. The angle says: Yes. I know how <i>you</i> taste.

Name: A sort of hunt
Id: 155805

Name: The attraction of reflection
Id: 155806
Description: The Ferret admires itself in a mirror: the sleek fur of its leg. It rolls its lip to admire its teeth. Or is that what it's doing? Is it yawning? Or mesmerised by the mirror? Impossible to say.
