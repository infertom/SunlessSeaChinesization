Name: Try something mysterious
Id: 127974
Description: What exactly is 'tyrant's treat'? The vendor is vague. It looks something like a charred stick dripping with bluish fluid.

		DefaultEvent
Name: Hold your nose
Id: 149352
Description: You follow the vendor's advice, holding your nose as you swallow, but the smell - something like rotting fruit - still makes you gag. The 'stick' is leathery - the blue stuff is rubbery as drying mucus. You fail to keep it down, and disgrace your captaincy there on the street.

Name: Rare and delicious!
Id: 149353
Description: Tyrant-moth antennae! You know how to deal with these. You break it into fragments and swallow the dripping fragments each in a gulp, exhaling briskly to savour the vapours afterwards. It's a complex rather than a pleasant flavour, but its tonic effects are marvellous.

Id: 149354
Description: Traces of its venom still remain - just enough to make your tongue tingle and alter your consciousness a touch. Your pulse accelerates, and odd thoughts sparkle in the forefront of your mind.
