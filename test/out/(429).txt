Id: 143279

		DefaultEvent
Name: Into the woods
Id: 175467
Description: Wide natural paths run between clumps of trees, softly lit by a dim green glow and the occasional glimmer of false-stars through the canopy. Only the cracking of leaves and the soothing sounds of water break the serenity of this volcano-forged paradise.

Name: Relax in a hot spring
Id: 143433
Description: Steam and a hint of sulphur gently rise from a secluded natural pool flanked by trees and mushrooms.

		DefaultEvent
Name: A moment for yourself
Id: 175685
Description: You slip out of your itchy clothes and into the welcoming caress of hot, deep water. The salts and sweats of zailing life melt away as you simply float, bare and free. Above, false-stars glimmer bright enough to be worth wishing on. All around, the glow of the trees casts ambient calm on the silent peace. How long has it been since you had a moment like this? Since London? Longer?

Id: 143436
Description: Let this moment be yours and yours alone, not wasted on worldly concerns.

		DefaultEvent
Name: Nothing but relaxation
Id: 175688
Description: The heat wraps around your bare skin like a lover's embrace as you lean back and float in the deep pool. There is no responsibility here. No guilt. No sea monsters. No tomb-colonists or sorrow-spiders or tentacles or nightmares in the dark. Just a moment of peace, to enjoy and celebrate for what it is. Just-

Description: What is the Likely Lass doing right now? Are you on her mind like she is on yours?

		DefaultEvent
Name: Oh, those nights in Wolfstack Docks!
Id: 175733
Description: The noise! The passion! The delightful filth! The hot water hugs you tight as you remember her touch, your last words before departing, that half-smile almost but not quite blossoming into completeness. How long will it be before you feel the touch of skin on skin once again? Or wake to see her sleeping brow, always so furrowed, as soft and calm as the zee itself-

How long will it be before you feel the touch of skin on skin once again, or wake to see that hat sitting at the end of the bed while he-

Name: A thought for the East...
Id: 143461
Description: Few zailors are resourceful enough to get this far, where the stories end and the myths begin.

		DefaultEvent
Name: Out on the edge of civilisation
Id: 175735
Description: From here, the lights of home are just a memory. The zee is blacker, its tales more guarded. It is not enough to simply keep zailing; none who try ever return home. Perhaps that is the price demanded by Salt, as you've overheard the crew darkly murmur when they think no one hears. That doesn't mean that-

		DefaultEvent
Name: Your legacy to the world, come what may
Id: 175736
Description: Their story is yet to be written. Perhaps the zee beckons them as it did you. Perhaps it does not. Salt cannot run in everyone's veins. Will they be the toast of the Singing Mandrake? Run with the scoundrels of the Flit? You cannot be as much of their life as they may or may not wish you to be, but that doesn't mean they-

Description: Ambition brought you this far in your journey, and, one way or another, ambition will end it. But have you changed on your journeys? Has it?

		DefaultEvent
Name: Every day, another step closer
Id: 175737
Description: There are as many reasons to take to the zee as there are zailors. For money. Power. The joy of exploration. To head NORTH, and d__m the consequences. Most never come close to fulfilling their ambition, but you... you are different. You know what you want, and with a sturdy crew by your side, you will achieve it. Perhaps none will remember your name afterwards. That does not mean you cannot leave your mark-

		DefaultEvent
Name: The endless adventure
Id: 175738
Description: You could travel a lifetime and never see all her secrets. Perhaps it has been longer. Time moves differently out here, in the still blackness and changeless light of candles and false-stars. Had you a chance to start over, what would you have done differently? What paths might you have followed? What deeds could you still-

Name: Memories of a time long ago
Id: 175753
Description: Do you even remember how long you have been at zee? It could have been a lifetime, in the perpetual gloom under ever-changing false-stars. You remember the first step on your very own ship, the first breath of that zee-air. The first sight of the endless black with all its wonder and terror. You remember-

Description: You are not about to let your guard down again.

		DefaultEvent
Name: You return to the rowboat
Id: 175850
Description: Now you look carefully, you can see the traps hidden in the forest. All things considered, it is for the best the 'Ghost of the Ash Isthmus' saw you as a playmate instead of an invader. There are reasons both humans and the smarter apes leave her to her own devices.

Name: The Monkey Foundling's Hut
Id: 145746
Description: She does not seem to be here right now. A pair of Pentecost apes are though, glaring at you with equal parts malice and their usual avarice.

		DefaultEvent
Name: Chased away!
Id: 179455
Description: The two Pentecost apes attack, snarling and hissing. Their raw ferocity forces a retreat, though they do not follow and press the advantage. Once you are through the trees, the chase ends. Peering through the foliage, you see them quietly return to their strange vigil.

Name: The Monkey Foundling's Hut
Id: 145747
Description: She is inside, snoring. A pair of Pentecost apes stand vigil outside, glaring at you with equal parts malice and their usual avarice for souls.

		DefaultEvent
Name: Sometimes the zee gives back
Id: 179456
Description: The apes snarl and leap, ready to rend with tooth and claw. But something stops them. They fall silent at the sight of the locket hanging from your neck. It is not clear if they desire it, are afraid of it, or are simply confused.
<br /><br />
You open it, snapping the rust. Inside is a faded picture of a sleeping blonde baby; red ribbon tied around her blanket as tight as she now keeps it around her arm.
<br /><br />
The larger ape comes close; stares at the photo. The smaller one has to look away. It is said, oft with a scowl, that the Pentecost apes will take anything from the souls they steal. Language. Habits. Gestures. It is rarely considered that, sometimes, they may take the best.
<br /><br />
Inside the hut, the Monkey Foundling sleeps soundly, completely unaware of her protectors in the forest.
<br /><br />
It is time to leave her to her dreams.

		SuccessEvent
Name: A meal of berries
Id: 175689
Description: Some are sweet, some are sour. None are as tempting as a plate of salted pork with the worms already picked out, but they fill a corner or two perfectly acceptably.

		RareSuccessEvent
Name: Berries of the gods!
Id: 175692
Description: These red berries aren't just sweet, they melt into your tongue like sugar. The rest of the crew would never forgive you if you didn't bring some back.
