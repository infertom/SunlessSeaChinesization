Name: Rat Corsairs
Id: 143960
Description: Ah, the gully: the ambusher's favourite terrain feature. It looked like such a short and easy way. But now a sudden flood of black and white fur confronts you: a starving torrent of rattus faber corsairs! Their chief addresses you in a piping unhuman voice: "Easy there, me giants! We're in dire need, here. Lend us help, and we'll pay well for it. No need to fight." (But you notice his rat-hand is on the hilt of his rat-cutlass.)

Description: The Wretched Mog has been riding on a Gap-Toothed Gunner's shoulder. Now it arches its back and hisses like a hatful of scalding serpents.

Name: Fearful symmetry
Id: 146442
Description: Ratwork rifles roar! Zailors stamp! The gully is filled with screeching and zalty oaths. And the Mog is everywhere. Rats scatter like chaffy grain. Its mouth drips crimson: its eyes blaze yellow. At last you stand triumphant, and the rats are fled or dead. You draw a string of drowning-pearls from the weskit of the rat-captain. His eyes are already filming with death, but he hisses savagely "To the Seven Cats with yer..."

A single zailor is dead. His throat has been torn from ear to ear. It doesn't look like a rat-bite. You glance at the Mog. It is washing its face with a casual paw.

Poor Tilman has been bitten almost to the bone. The wound is filthy. You clean it as best you can, but he won't last the week.
