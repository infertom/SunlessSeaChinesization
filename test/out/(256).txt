Name: Invite him to dine with you
Id: 127633
Description: His tastes are spartan - he eats little, drinks only water, barely sleeps at all - so you need only lay a simple table.

		DefaultEvent
Name: An appeal
Id: 148801
Description: "Thanks for the meal. And the company. No, no wine. It makes me sleepy. Oh, yes, I can sleep! Too easily - that's the problem." He hesitates.
<br/><br/>
"There's a draught I take nightly, to substitute for sleep. It works well enough, and it keeps me sane and upright, but I wish I could enjoy just one night's sleep. If you could help me..."
<br/><br/>
"We need a Clay Man, from Polythreme. We'll need a Mirrorcatch Box. And we'll need to go to Hunter's Keep. I'll explain when we get there. No, I'm serious. I would owe you a great deal." [Mirrorcatch Boxes are rarely sold in London, but can be found in the Khanate and occasionally elsewhere.]

Name: Allow the Mechanic to enjoy his sleep
Id: 146679
Description: "It might be messy," he warns you. "Could you have a couple of strong zailors standing by? Tell them to snap the box shut when the trouble begins." He holds up a bottle of laudanum. "<i>I</i> will be sleeping <i>deeply</i>."

		DefaultEvent
Name: A certain amount of excitement
Id: 181078
Description: When nothing seems to be happening, you take to your own bunk - but a roar from the Clay Man brings you sprinting back to the Mechanic's cabin. You fling open the door.
<br/><br/>
The Man's eyes seethe with viric flame! It's struggling against the efforts of the zailors to restrain it. As you rush to assist, it flings one zailor off - but the other manages to snap the box closed. Instantly the Man goes stiff - a lifeless clay statue. The viric glow now pulsates from the box.
<br/><br/>
In the bunk, the Mechanic sleeps on, his face wreathed in dreamy smiles. He will sleep so until morning.

Id: 181421

<br/><br/>
"I found a secret in those dreams. An engine like the zee's never seen. Oh, captain, captain, let me build it for you. You won't be sorry! But there are some things I'll need. (I know, I know. Isn't it always the way?)"
