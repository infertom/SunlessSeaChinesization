Name: The Widower
Id: 153576
Description: "Hello. Come in. Sit down. I believe you have some news about my wife? I paid the ransom. Of course I did, and of course I never heard anything more. Please. Where is she? What happened?"

		ChildBranches 1
Name: "Your wife is a mindless shell."
Id: 130587
Description: Tell him the truth, however horrible. The bees, the cages, the slow and agonising theft of her memories.

		DefaultEvent
Name: Hands to his mouth
Id: 153577
Description: "I - I had heard terrible things of the Isle of Cats, but I had never imagined - how? How did she come to that?"

		ChildBranches 2
Name: "Your wife died while escaping."
Id: 148030
Description: Tell him it was instant, and painless. It's a lie, but perhaps a kind one.

		DefaultEvent
Name: A long hiss of breath
Id: 183100
Description: "I - I see. I knew she must be dead. You have set my mind at rest, at least. But how - how did she come to be their prisoner?"

Name: Tell him of the captain's gambling debts and brothel-bill
Id: 148031
Description: Let him know what kind of woman he married. Of course, perhaps he already knew.

		DefaultEvent
Name: A long soft sigh
Id: 183101
Description: "Yes. Yes, when we were married, she admitted - certain predilections. I wish... but I know how it is for a zee-captain. I would have forgiven her anything, if only she had returned to me. But - why the Isle of Cats? What was she doing in that sump of malice?"

Name: Tell him the captain was taken in combat
Id: 148032
Description: Suggest valour brought low by ill luck.

		DefaultEvent
Name: A wry smile
Id: 183102
Description: "Yes. Yes, she was never prudent. I feared so for her, every voyage. I had pleaded with her to be more careful, though I never really thought she would be. But - why the Isle of Cats? What was she doing in that sump of malice?"

		ChildBranches 5
Name: Tell him his wife was a red honey smuggler
Id: 148033
Description: Red honey: so vile, it's not even illegal.

		DefaultEvent
Name: An open mouth
Id: 183103
Description: "I had never imagined - ! You're sure? Of course. Of course. I don't mean to question your honesty. But red honey! I'm sorry. I need a moment to collect my thoughts..."
<br/><br/>"You know: her captors let her write to me. At the bottom of the letter, she had added a phrase I never understood: ONLY THOSE WHO DO NOTHING MAKE NO ERRORS. I think perhaps I understand it now."

Name: Tell him his wife was a pirate-hunter
Id: 148034
Description: It's plausible. Any pirate-hunter might prowl the waters around the Isle of Cats, or even slip into the harbour and mingle with their targets.

		DefaultEvent
Name: A wry half-smile
Id: 183104
Description: "That sounds like her. She would pursue an escaping enemy to the very North of the zee, never mind the Isle of Cats. Of course she knew it would doom her some day. Thank you."<br/><br/>"You know: her captors let her write to me. At the bottom of the letter, she had added a phrase I never understood: ONLY THOSE WHO DO NOTHING MAKE NO ERRORS.

Name: Give him the box
Id: 148035
Description: ONLY THOSE WHO DO NOTHING MAKE NO ERRORS. Is that the phrase that will open it? Did the captain hope the box would find its way to him, somehow?
<br/>
[Or you could keep the box to open it yourself: use it from your inventory if so.]

		DefaultEvent
Name: A breath and a click
Id: 183105
Description: You explain how the box came to you, and how you began this quest. Irem, the Isle, and now here. You have your zailors bring the box in, and the Widower whispers the opening phrase. It clicks open with a sound as sweet and precise as a well-answered riddle. He takes a breath and flings back the lid.
<br/><br/>
A soul glowing like a hidden star. Heaped sapphires from the Elder Continent. A Presbyterate heart-cup. A water-stained journal, blurred to near-unreadability - an account of a failed expedition to the Mountain of Light...
<br/><br/>
The Widower looks them over. Abruptly, he snatches the heart-cup, and shoves the box towards you.
<br/><br/>
"Too many memories, [q:Addressed As]. I'll keep this one memory only. You deserve something. You crossed the zee to find the truth for me. Here. Take them, and leave me now." He turns away.

<br/><br/>
Books of poetry, pamphlets of a racier nature. A velvet-wrapped collection of ivory Chelonate carvings. A Mirrorcatch box leaking sunlight. The Widower looks them over. Abruptly, he snatches one book and one carving, and shoves the box towards you.
