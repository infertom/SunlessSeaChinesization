Name: The Trouble with Tomb-Colonists
Id: 169785
Description: You've brought this decaying emigrant north. Now what?

		ChildBranches 1
Name: Watch carefully
Id: 139821
Description: Something is happening to the man in the bandages. He sighs. He groans. He clutches his chest.

		DefaultEvent
Name: A soft explosion
Id: 169786
Description: His bandages burst! Frost-moths clamber from the tatters. Nothing of him remains. The frost-moths - icy wings shining - take to the air, spiral, dissipate, are gone.
<br/><br/>
He won't pay his passage now. At least he's left his belongings for sale.

Name: Make no promise of discretion
Id: 139829
Description: Keep your nose clean. You'll drop her off at the dock, as you promised, and after that, it's her problem.

		DefaultEvent
Name: Exposure
Id: 169810
Description: She grumbles and struggles, but you force her ashore. The bandaged figures on the dock watch the proceedings with interest. She doesn't pass the Skin-Check. Her possesions are forfeited: half of them fall due to you. "You'll be sorry!" she yells as the tomb-colonists drag her away.

Name: Days of Shrooms and Roses
Id: 139904
Description: The new tomb-colonist surveys Venderbight, shaking her head. "It won't do," she says. "It won't do at all."

		DefaultEvent
Name: A plan!
Id: 169934
Description: "I had no idea the place would be quite so unprepossessing. Perhaps we can liven it up a little, yet. If only I knew a helpful zee-captain..."
<br/><br/>
[Bring ten units of Mushroom Wine to Venderbight, and perhaps they'll have something for you.]

Name: The New Jonah
Id: 139906
Description: Your passenger stands sombrely by the rail. "Salt sent me a dream," she insists. "You must find my father."


		DefaultEvent
Name: A fisherman's tale
Id: 169936
Description: "Salt tells me that you'll find my father in the belly of a monstrous eel. Gods never lie."
<br/><br/>
Gods never lie? That seems optimistic. But if she's right, she'll reward you for her father's return.

Name: An Absent Friend
Id: 139907
Description: "It is everything I imagined!" he tells you breathlessly. "But there's someone missing. Please - bring her to me."

		DefaultEvent
Name: A vague commission
Id: 169937
Description: "She went off to the Mangrove College. She needed to get out of London. But Venderbight is just as safe as the College. And I'll wager she's bored of mud by now."
<br/><br/>
[Look for the Shady Sort in the Mangrove College, somewhere in the south of the Unterzee.]

		ChildBranches 6
Name: Help out an immigrant
Id: 141558
Description: Your tomb-colonist passenger yanks off her bandages. She looks remarkably healthy for a tomb-colonist. "I'm not as dead as I look," she confesses. "And I won't get ashore without your help. Yes, the Constables are looking for me back home. Is that a problem?"

		DefaultEvent
Name: Muffled oars
Id: 172697
Description: You slip your furtive passenger past the Skin-Check Post and the Confirmation of Consolation. "Thanks, cap'n," she remarks casually. "Let me teach you a couple of tricks. Just in case you do this again. And here's a little hush-money."

Name: One Last Fight
Id: 139905
Description: Your passenger has been drinking. "Ahoy!" she chortles. "Defend yourself!" She launches a tipsy assault. Your crew hang back, chuckling. Thanks, crew.

		DefaultEvent
Name: A defeat!
Id: 169935
Description: Drunk as she is, her skills are formidable. "I was carving men up," she informs you, "when you were still in the cradle." She flips your weapon over the side, embraces you, and staggers off down the gang-plank, gone for good. Your pride is hurt, and your ribs and head ache abominably. All these things are valuable lessons.

		SuccessEvent
Name: An effortless defence
Id: 172545
Description: Tomb-colonists have a life-time of bitter experience. Some of them are the deadliest combatants under the earth. Possibly this one is, when she hasn't drunk quite so much rum. You'll never know. She salutes you, laughing, after you disarm her. "Good fight!" she opines. Then she staggers backwards and falls over the side.
<br/><br/>
You never do find what happened to her. But at least you have her rather magnificent cavalry sabre, and her belongings.
