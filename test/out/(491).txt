Name: A Meeting with the Pirate King
Id: 169576
Description: What might one expect from Leopold, Pirate-King of the Isle of Cats: a hulking, grizzled presence with a crimson cat tattooed across his back? An oil-bearded wretch with a brace of pistols strapped to each hip, and eyes like wildfire? A gaunt-cheeked honey-seeker wasted from years of dissolution?

He looks, as it turns out, more like a lawyer than a dissolute lord - though he is at least wearing a robe of patterned-silk over his dark suit. Behind him you see a wall of what you think are wine-racks. On closer inspection, the racks hold bottle upon carefully-labelled bottle of red honey.

Description: Isery enters with a wine-glass of thick honey; behind them Zaira drags in a stumbling prisoner. It is the sailor you stole from the Cumaean Canal, only they do not seem to recognise you at all.
