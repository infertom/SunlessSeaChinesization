Name: The Amethyst Gallery
Id: 181456
Description: Perspective confounds you. This place stretches away every direction through a dusty purple haze, as if you float in a cloud. The air is chill and crackling. Vast and shadowy shapes hang lifeless in the distant cloud, fluid staining their hides. Whale-things and beast-things, bigger than dirigibles, bigger than cities. You are a speck in the cloud. Are you still inside Frostfound?
<br/><br/>
Once again, there is a voice, lifeless as leaden type. THERE WERE CASUALTIES.

Name: Terror profundi
Id: 181458
Description: Great sad dead eyes like stagnant crater-lakes. Mouths which could drink rivers. Your entire ship would be a glint on a speck in a pockmark on the least limb of these things. Every time you enter battle, you will remember this.

Name: An old familiar fear
Id: 181496
Description: Great sad dead eyes like stagnant crater-lakes. Mouths which could drink rivers. Your entire ship would be a glint on a speck in a pockmark on the least limb of these things. But you are a zee-captain. Your enemy, your companion, is the Unterzee, against which even the eldest of these beasts is nothing.
