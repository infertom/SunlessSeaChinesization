Description: <i>In May, my brother Richard and I took service on the </i>Bonny Swan<i> - he as bosun, I as navigator. The captain, Swinburne, was a good man, but ambitious. When we reached Kingeater's Castle our supplies were low, but we pressed on in the hope of finding land. There was none.</i>

Description: <i>I mistook my readings and set a bad course. For days we steamed north-west - not west - into the empty dark. Our supplies ran out, and still no sign of port. Hunger set in, and terror, and what I pray was madness. Ravening, desperate, raving, we agreed to draw lots, with the loser giving up life and flesh so the others could go on.</i>

Description: <i>My dear, solemn, solid Richard. There were more after. Seven times we drew. Seven of our number went into the pot, and not a one of them quietly. Those of us who made it back to port swore never to speak of our crime, but one of us - someone with a keener conscience than mine - confessed. I fled the noose to zee again. I regret it all. I will do anything. Please.</i>
