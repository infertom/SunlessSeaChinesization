Description: "Leopold has a particular fascination with the Surface. He still thinks of it as home, in some ways. Endearing, isn't it?" She doesn't wait for your answer. "Personally, I've drunk the memories of so many homes, I couldn't pick a particular one out of the lot. Tricky things."<br><br>
"Still, it does make him easier to buy birthday presents for. Have I muddled this up? I did say I set up a meeting with the King for you, didn't I? Well. I did."

Name: You politely decline
Id: 139655
Description: You are not entirely sure you wish an introduction to the Pirate-King, and you are not terribly keen on the transport of unwilling gifts, as it were. [Refusal will lock you out of further work for Zaira.]

Description: "I've mucked up the timing, haven't I? Or maybe it's you that's broken. Are you? It's so hard to tell, in this light. I'm supposed to do something, aren't I?" Zaira looks confused for a moment, and then stamps her foot in a charade of rage. "You are banished from my presence! Begone, foul disappointment!" She gives you a wink, before her face clears. "But really, I am rather cross. Yes? Mmm. I probably won't kill you. But one never quite knows, does one?"
