Name: A narrow escape
Id: 155000
Description: You see him start when he takes in your foreign dress, but he's eager for any assistance. You hobble away together to a safe distance. "Thank you," he gasps. "Here - your share." He extracts a garnet-eyed wolf-figurine from his clinking leather satchel, and hobbles away into the night.

Name: A flashing smile
Id: 155002
Description: A devilishly handsome young man! "Oh, thank you," he says. He peers at your face, and adds "Thank you!" in English this time. "I was visiting a friend of mine, and her, er, other friend, well, close friend, well, husband, came home early. I could have been very embarrassed. Oh, Great Wind, you've recognised my face, haven't you?" (You haven't.) "Look, I'll put a word in for you with the Clan. Drop by the palace some day, and I'll see you're remembered. Don't mention my name, though. Here's my boat. You! Pilot! Pay this one. He's a friend of the Leopard."
