The Outcast has gnostic secrets of profound culinary import to impart. Even its lesser revelations are enough to touch your dreams with the dread of drowning. Perhaps fortunately, it gets so excited when it talks about the greater revelations that you don't have any idea what the hell it's on about.

		DefaultEvent
Name: An untidy dinner
Id: 165530
Description: Where did it learn to cook? Not in its amber-smeared home-tunnels, because it obviously prefers its food raw. Between gulps and flabbers, it attempts to chat.
<br/><br/>
It's hard to decipher its words. Its mouth is full of fish-flesh; its mind is alien; and besides, it's terribly shy. Consequently, the evening is not a great success.
<br/><br/>
But you learn a little of its past. It was abandoned in Port Cecil for Rubbery crimes - crimes whose nature quite slip the surly bonds of language. The Principles found it an apt tool, and has been its patron ever since. It begins to say "I ushed to love - " and then suddenly excuses itself.

		DefaultEvent
Name: It shakes its head firmly, tentacles slapping its neck
Id: 165531
Description: "Shalt-Flions," it lisps. "Shaltsh Ftention." It turns an earnest eye to you. Apparently it wants to visit the Salt-Lions before it will speak further to you. At least no other crew were around to witness a Rubbery Man rejecting a human invitation.

		DefaultEvent
Name: A jubilant dinner
Id: 166165
Description: The Survivor still struggles with human language, but its shyness, for now, is gone. It gestures widely with the fork (not long ago, it was embarrassed to pick up a fork). It speaks of its plans to visit Flute Street below London, where its relatives dwell: to bring them gifts of knowledge which will erase its crimes.
<br><br>
It tells you stories of travel through the void on the vast-shelled black back of a messenger thing. It shares jokes from its spawn-world, Axile. None of the jokes make any sense, but they linger on the surfaces of your thought like graffiti scrawled in a language you knew when you were very young...

Id: 146910
Description: It bends its face. You've known it long enough to understand that this is an affectionate smile. Are you sure about this? [The Survivor can only evince the proper responses in the presence of sufficient Scintillack.]

		DefaultEvent
Name: Glimmering intensities
Id: 181426
Description: Flesh meets membrane. Apertures pulse. The Survivor enfolds you like a tide. The narcotic pleasures of union engulf you! Again and again, you rise to impossible spasms of unknown emotion, until you subside into a pool of mingled exudate. "Sho... sho..." the Survivor pants, its glabrous flanks heaving.
<br/><br/>
[For God's sake don't let anyone find out about this. Especially your crew. Especially any lover you might have in port.]
