Name: The Mangrove College
Id: 143391
Description: A steaming sprawl of parasynthetic vegetation - and a village. Barely a village. Holed walls, roofs in disrepair, stilts leaning dangerously. It looks to have been assembled by drunks in a hurry. Dock carefully.

Description: "The Corsair's Forest, please. Gaider's Mourn. No, I'm not in a hurry, but I think I might stay below decks. I don't carry the fee on me: you'll have to trust me for it when we arrive. Thank you. A pleasure."

Name: Eat, drink, be merry

Description: The philosophers of the College are not hospitable, but this whole shoreline is bursting with fruit and edible fungus. Reach up and it falls into your hand. Pick it up, and it's already fermented.

		DefaultEvent
Name: An explosion of tastes
Id: 143393
Description: Tart morels and morel tart. The salty tang of zeeweed stew. A crawling berry that the locals assure you is a motile plant, not an insect. Eat your fill, and drink contemplatively.

Name: Into the Wisp-Ways
Id: 134239
Description: The swamps around the village are full of mud, crocodiles and vegetable treasures, including the notorious parasite called 'solacefruit'. The fogs and spreading branches occlude all light. [Take plenty of candles if you venture in.]

Name: Unpick the Mysteries of the Zee
Id: 134244
Description: Some of the 'philosophers' of the College have the grizzled air of old zailors. Retired mariners? Or pirates who've come here to avoid attention?

		DefaultEvent
Name: Vivid stories
Id: 159497
Description: A Wary Hermit, her eyes bright, helps you sift truth from nonsense. By the end of it, she sighs with longing. 'The zee...' she says. "But no. I'm here for good."

Name: Meet your contact
Id: 134317
Description: An Enigmatic Gentleman lives a comfortable life in the largest hut. He won't see you without an appointment, but the Admiralty has arranged that appointment.

		DefaultEvent
Name: An island of civilisation
Id: 159601
Description: Once inside the hut, you might imagine yourself back in London. Bright candle-light, thick carpets (a little spotted with damp), even wallpaper (similarly spotted). Two philosophers wait on you both, a little sulkily. The Enigmatic Gentleman will say nothing until you've both eaten dinner (a fine, if eclectic meal: cavern-trout, swamp-fruits, spices from Adam's Way and Whither, served on Delft ware at a lacquered Ming table). When you're done, he gives you a carefully itemised list of ship sightings, some excellent port and a little something to take away. "Remember me to the Admiral," he says fondly.

		DefaultEvent
Name: All shall be well
Id: 159961
Description: The thinkers of the Mangrove College continue their untroubled and sedentary existence. New schools of philosophy are born and die like bubbles. Extraordinary poetries are written in water. The occasional retired pirate tries, and fails, to get invited to salons.
