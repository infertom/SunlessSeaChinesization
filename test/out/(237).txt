Name: Maroon the Prisoner
Id: 129254

Name: Release the Prisoner
Id: 129144
Description: Offer them an amnesty, on their solemn parole. [Success in this Hearts test means they're more likely to become Crew again; but it doesn't ensure it.]

		DefaultEvent
Name: A savage outcome
Id: 151262
Description: Your Prisoner comes out meekly enough, but the moment the shackles are off, it's a different story. It takes three men to get him off you, and by the time you smash him to the deck, his teeth are buried in another zailor's throat. You give both their bodies to the zee. This was not a good day.

Name: Betrayal!
Id: 151456
