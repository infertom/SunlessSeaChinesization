Name: What's this? A dead one of those!
Id: 167908
Description: It is a hilarious joke! But nobody laughs. They don't even look. Do they shift slightly away from you? Some people just don't understand comedy.

		DefaultEvent
Name: She peels them away, one at a time
Id: 167797
Description: A crowd has gathered around a lithe dancer clothed in veils. They flutter into the audience one by one, caught and clutched and their perfume drunk deep by the rowdy audience. The hollering soon changes though as, still clothed in little but scandal, she disappears behind a conveniently placed bit of painted scenery and an obese dockworker emerges to finish the job. 
<br /><br />
Nobody feels a desire to sniff his silks. Though he does still gets his share of cat-calls.

Name: A dive into silks
Id: 167907
Description: There is a huge pile of it placed in the tallest ship in the Nativity's frozen flotilla, atop which a well-nailed plank now stretches for those that dare walk it. Spurred by the mocking challenges of the traders, you find yourself facing a drop a good deal higher than it looked from the ground. But there's no backing out now. The silks open up to greet you; cool, soft, embracing.

		DefaultEvent
Name: "A gift, from the pestiferous masters."
Id: 167798
Description: The Nocturne? The Lorn-Fluke? Of such things, he will not speak. But his masters appear quite content with how things have resolved, even volunteering a prize secret from their own collection as payment.
<br /><br />
"Curiosity can be such a curse, can it not?" says the Emissary of Spiders. "If you are to be absorbed by an enigma I would heartily recommend it be this. A far safer one than any other you shall find here, to be sure."
<br /><br />
He bows. And, stroking the sorrow-spider on his shoulder, he returns to his masters, where a tortured Lorn-Fluke already screams for the sake of a secret that never was and another the spiders will never tell.

Id: 167800
Description: ...a ring of rostygold forged by leaders of the Iron Republic that can only be destroyed by being dropped into Mt Palmerston? "Why not just tie it to a trained zee-bat?" demands a Pedantic Listener. The crowd jeers, but the mood is still spoiled.

Id: 167804
Description: ...a whole new world to the East, where the moon pines for the heart of the ocean? The crowd is transfixed by stories of their forbidden romance; how she strokes its surface to create the waves and it reflects her face that it might share her smile.
