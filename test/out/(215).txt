Id: 148062
Description: Not much later, you are standing in the mist watching a parade of Clay Men. They hoist the boxes on their shoulders and march away, surprisingly quiet, towards the building with the steeple.

An Austere Acolyte leads them, her lamp swinging on a chain.

Name: Follow because you're curious
Id: 127085
Description: The shipment would appear to be something other than provisions in the ordinary sense.

		DefaultEvent
Name: Thumping cargo
Id: 148064
Description: One of the clay men stumbles and his box slips from his shoulder. There is a sound as though a sleeper's head, inside, had thumped against the lid. But no one wakes, and the box is soon back in position.

Name: Follow because the singing has got into your bones
Id: 127086
Description: The Austere Acolyte sings all the time when she is not speaking. The words of the song bother and fascinate and compel.

Name: Fever dreams
Id: 148065
Description: You walk close enough to the Acolyte to hear the next verse. It concerns the smell of hot brick, the chime of ashes falling on the grate, and the pleasure of braiding pokers together on a winter's night when there is nothing else to do.
