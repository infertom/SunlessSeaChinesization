Description: They may be mistaken for marauding ghosts: shot, burnt or exorcised. Well, they should have stayed home if they wanted an easy life.

Description: Your tomb-colonists return, delighted, brandishing their sketches of the Khaganian palaces. One intends to remodel Venderbight after Khan's Glory. "It'll take decades," she opines. "Decades! I may be long gone." She sighs. "Long gone."

Description: "He's gone," one of them explains. "They put him in a sort of crucible and extracted him into jars. They're selling him as 'ghost-dust' in the Nephrite Quarter now. I don't think they actually thought he was a ghost. I think they thought he was a spy. They're not very friendly, the Khaganians, are they? Where are we going now?"

Name: Tea and spiced toast
Id: 175336
Description: Your tomb-colonists are treated with courtesy, despite their unpromising appearance. Some Khaganians revere their ancestors; perhaps that's why. When the colonists return, they're chattering freely about the layout of the Leopard's palace. Note that information down: it will come in useful to someone.

Name: Unusual confidences
Id: 175352
Description: Ruins of a previous civilisation underlie Venderbight. Tomb-colonists have unearthed the secrets of the Third City. Rather rudely, they haven't chosen to share those secrets with you: instead, they've divulged them to Khaganian officials. But they're very happy to share the information that the Khaganians shared in turn...
