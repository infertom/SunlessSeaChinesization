Name: Glints like eyes
Id: 173747
Description: Glossy black fragments gleamed malevolently in the blankness of the ice. You'd swear it oriented them towards you. Some sort of sensory apparatus?

"Captain!" your first officer is shouting. "Captain!" You blink. The moth is a muddy swirl on the waves.
