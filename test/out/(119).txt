Name: A quiet afternoon
Id: 178724
Description: Rain at funerals is decorous. The Neath chooses to grace this afternoon with one of its thin and melancholy showers. Water-drops glisten on the shovel, the coffin, the pale expanse of the vicar's forehead. Not many Londoners remember your father, but the sense of occasion - the long quest! the final return to rest! - has brought out a sizeable crowd. Mourners line up to shake your hand. When they speak, you hear only the zee.
<br/><br/>
Afterwards, you give the servants an evening off. The house is empty. The clock ticks. The roof-beams creak companionably. You can still hear the zee.
