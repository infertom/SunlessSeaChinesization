		DefaultEvent
Name: A cask of wine

Name: A coffin - 
Id: 148280
Description: You lever open the lid, and a bandaged head stirs, turns. "Already?" its voice creaks. "I'm so tired." A tomb-colonist! Do you have space in your hold?

Name: A curious sac
Id: 127242
Description: Slice it open. What's within?

		DefaultEvent
Name: Stripped clean
Id: 148278

Name: "Zee-eggs."
Id: 148281

Name: Mortal remains
Id: 127243
Description: Peel away the membrane, and - stifle a shudder - a half-digested zailor clutching a half-digested book. You'll dispose of the poor remnant decently, but what does the book say?

		DefaultEvent
Name: Fair dealing
Id: 148279
Description: '...I met her again that September. Her hair was gone, and her hand, and she could remember nothing that had occurred to her before the age of nineteen. I could scarcely speak for horror, but she responded nonchalantly. "I think my eyes will be next," she told me. "I hardly need them down here in the dark, and the Convention will offer me an excellent price for them."
<br/><br/>
Reader: shun the Brimstone Convention. They will not cheat you. Worse, they will make you offers you cannot bear to refuse...'

Name: Thousands
Id: 148282
Description: "...hull-down on the horizon. But as we drew closer, we all grew puzzled: it was like no ship we had ever seen, a curious congeries of multiple hulls and jointed... limbs? Then we knew it had sighted us, for thick smoke rose as it roused its engines and gave chase. Its limbs bristled. Through the glass now I could see what lay at the meeting-point of its faces: thousands upon thousands of spider-eyes, champing spider-fangs, fused together like wax. A spider-council! but one of unprecedented size, and crammed strangely into a hybrid ship. It could only be the Tree of Ages: and the first day of our flight began..."

Name: Amber?
Id: 148283

		DefaultEvent
Name: And still within - 
Id: 148284
Description: It's something like a scrappy little shark. It has scales like dark rainbows. A peculiar flint nodule is crammed sideways into its mouth. How did that happen?

		RareDefaultEvent
Name: A brief mystery
Id: 148295
Description: It takes you a while to work out what this is, but eventually you realise it's a puckered sucker - perhaps from the tip of a tentacle. If so, it's a tentacle of truly preposterous size. The sucker is the size of a man's head...



	ChildBranches 6
Name: Gummed with hardened mucus
Id: 127246

		DefaultEvent

Description: What is this oddly angled object trapped in salty flesh?

		DefaultEvent
Name: Pleading eyes
Id: 148287
Description: It comes free: a statuette chipped from volcanic rock. Its expression is somehow desperate. The work is both skilled and exotic. You'll find a buyer, you're certain.

		RareDefaultEvent
Name: A pale form swims in quartz
Id: 148455
Description: Someone has bottled a soul in quartz. How is that possible? Then again, how is it possible to bottle souls at all? Never mind. Worry about who'll buy it, instead.

Name: Plaintive, but satisfying
Id: 148293

		DefaultEvent
Name: Eviction
Id: 148310

		RareDefaultEvent
Name: A lamp!
Id: 148453
Description: Faint traces of a label still read ...ATROYDS OYSTE... , but now the can holds light. An unknown hand has pierced holes; fitted a mount for a candle; ornamented it with elaborate scrollwork. Some collector of curiosities will pay a good price for this.
