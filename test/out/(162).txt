Name: Ashore in Visage
Id: 168605
Description: On the lower slopes: stone buildings, flat roofs, archways. In the architecture there lingers a memory of lotus and palm frond. The hill above is a face, forever looking up at the ceiling of the Unterzee. No one inhabits its cheeks or the hollows of its eyes.

Name: High water
Id: 168610

<br/><br/>
In a raised niche at the far end of the room sits a statue of a man with the head of a ram. He holds a jar from which water flows out onto the floor.

Id: 139269
Description: It has been making subtle overtures for some time. You only now understand them.

		DefaultEvent
Name: It is keen to go
Id: 168905
Description: It draws you aside into a closet in the Customs House. "Had enough of Visage," it tells you frankly. "Here, you take my mask and pretend to be me, and I'll trade in the visitor mask and get on some departing ship. Get my life back."
<br/><br/>
Its face - no, now you see, her face - is aging but unlined. A lifetime of never needing to use a facial expression.

Name: A shame about the Moth
Id: 169901
Description: You say farewell to the Moon-Moth. It makes gestures you now recognise as agitation. Perhaps there was some other plan for you here, but no one consulted you about it. You have other things to attend to.
<br/><br/>
Your last sight of Visage: the Moth smoothing the folds from your robe and hanging your mask on a peg for the next visitor.
