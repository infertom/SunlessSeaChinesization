Id: 147407
Description: He is soft-voiced. Courteous. Rarely makes eye-contact, but often stares at other people's eyes from afar.

Name: The nature of nature
Id: 147408
Description: "Sunlight is - in certain senses literally, quite literally, law. Without sunlight, the earth would spin off into space. And the absence of sunlight down here means the absence of a dozen laws. Death operates unreliably (though more reliably on the zee, as you know). Geography is uncertain and shifting. And dreams - dreams - "
<br/><br/>
He had grown animated - now he seems distracted. He apologises, and composes himself.
<br/><br/>
"It was a particular interest of mine. Luminosity. The anatomy of the eye. The many liberations of night... excuse me. This gruel is a little too rich for my tastes."

Description: "It's true: I fell in with - restless elements. The usual reasons, of course. Watching the Bazaar devour London, year by year. The iniquities of the rich and the pities of the poor. But more than that - I thought London needed darkness. Do you know what I mean? I thought the city was safer in the dark. Do you understand me? I applied my arts to that end. If you do, I need say no more, and if you don't, I should say no more - "

Id: 127615
Description: He has not caused any more trouble, but remains a cause for concern.

		DefaultEvent
Name: A man distracted
Id: 148779
Description: The guard reports that the Doctor has barely spoken since returning to work. He certainly has not smiled. He goes through the motions solely in the hope of being left alone, away from the scorn and suspicion of the crew. His patients leave mended, more or less, but their sutures are poorly stitched, their medications miscounted, and their bones carelessly set.
<br /><br />
The crew grumbles. A word must be had.

Name: An educational lesson

Description: The Doctor is methodical and scrupulous. You spend an informative afternoon, and learn much. However, when you ask detailed questions on the anatomy of the eye, he grows reticent, and soon ends the conversation, complaining of a headache...

		DefaultEvent
Name: A dour companion
Id: 180512
Description: The Doctor pushes more food around his plate than he puts into his mouth, and what he eats, he chews until all taste has been squeezed out. Between bites, he sips only water, evading all questions where opinion is sought.
<br /><br />
It is only when the subject turns to his trade that something flickers inside him, old memories of pain and pride. "I fear it was my training that let me see the world for what it was - its corpus infested by malignancies with human faces. How could I dare face Hippocrates in the hereafter if I just stood by and did nothing? <i>Nothing!"</i>
<br /><br />
His eye meets yours for the first time; fierce, damned. "If two drops of medicine can cure the body, could two drops of poison cure the world? For a moment, it actually seemed that easy."
<br /><br />
The fire fades. He pushes back his chair. "Pardon me, [q:Addressed As]. I fear I have had my fill for today."

Id: 146353
Description: The Haunted Doctor has kept to himself since dinner. Perhaps some wine will help him open up.

		DefaultEvent
Name: The art of poison
Id: 180513
Description: "I let most of them slip away peacefully, a drop of laudanum still on their tongues. For that sop to my conscience, I am most ashamed of all."
<br /><br />
The wine flows as the Haunted Doctor talks candidly of his past - of a status that allowed him to the bedsides of many of London's most infamous, and the black medicine bag that carried the tools of both his trades - doctor, and anarchist-poisoner.
<br /><br />
"I was a fool," he adds. "A <i>child.</i> Just a boy on a crusade, drinking in the rhetoric of the Calendar Council, thinking myself more than a mere poisoner. What I did, I do not regret. Would though that I had seen their true hearts before giving myself so freely to perdition."
<br /><br />
He raps his leather eyepatch. The sound is hollow; sickly. "It is a disappointment I well deserved. The Lady taught me that much, at least. I... No. Another time, perhaps. The hour grows late. I thank you for the company."
<br/><br/>
[The Doctor may have more to say after you've visited a place that touches his old interests.]

Name: A visit to Khan's Shadow?
Id: 180514
Description: "Our recent conversations have left me... nostalgic," the Haunted Doctor admits. His voice shakes slightly, though his fingers do not. "Should a suitable opportunity arise, I would remind myself that there are still those who dare to dream of a better world. It has been too long since I warmed my hands on such passion."
<br /><br />
He snips the thread. His work is, as ever, immaculate.

		DefaultEvent
Name: A realist is born...
Id: 180515
Description: It is not with anger but curiosity that you ask him what he hoped to achieve by betraying your trust. What plans could the anarchs have that would upend the very table where the Great Game is played? In the privacy of your cabin you let him in on your little corner of it. More. You give him your blessing to make use of anything he sees, if he truly believes it will achieve something worthwhile.
<br /><br />
He looks up. Pushes away the offered intelligence... which of course still has to be burned, as protocol demands. Something in his eye has gone, possibly forever. "You are right, of course. I will return to my duties. There at least I can still hope to serve."
<br /><br />
"Here. They gave me this in the Shadow. It is not fitting that I keep it. May you use it better than I would."

		DefaultEvent
Name: A nihilist is born...
Id: 180516
Description: By the last greasy flickers of a dying candle, you stand on deck with the Doctor and stare into the abyss. The question is not whether anything stares back, but whether it will choose to remain hidden. As you talk, the fellow's shoulders sink. He leans against the rail, considering the depths. Any arguments he might have made are swallowed by the emptiness.
<br /><br />
He looks up. Something in his eye has gone, possibly forever. "You are right, of course. I will return to my duties. There at least I can still hope to serve."

		DefaultEvent
Name: A patriot is born...
Id: 180517
Description: Over a meal of zee-trout and wine, you do your best to bring him round. Is the world perfect? No. Neither Surface nor Neath will ever make that claim. Is all well in London? Hardly. He is not wrong there. However, you point out, he has a better chance than most to put his unquestioned skills to use in the name of <i>all</i> her people. And his regrets? Well, to do something terrible for one's country is barely a matter for shame at all!
<br /><br />
He looks up. Something in his eye has gone, possibly forever. "You are right, of course. Perhaps I shall put about inquiries the next time we are in port. For now though, I will return to my duties. There at least I know that I can serve with a measure of honour."
<br /><br />

Still, he is a man who intimately knows all of his subjects. You definitely leave feeling that you have learned something important, if perhaps not exactly what.

Name: A slow afternoon's study
Id: 180568
Description: The Doctor speaks with the knowledge of a dusty textbook, and the enthusiasm to match. He drones about the nature of eyes in ways that make it hard to remember them capable of witnessing great beauty or weeping at equal sadness. Mid-way through, even he loses interest and spends what remains of the lesson doing little but staring thoughtfully out to zee.
