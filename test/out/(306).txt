Name: Favour the Chief Engineer
Id: 129725
Description: He seems grumpy but honest. Also you've seen what rat-made weapons can do, and perhaps you'd rather not be on the receiving end of them. 

		DefaultEvent
Name: A Rat in the Making
Id: 152195
Description: You extend a hand to the Chief Engineer, who shakes it grimly. The Seneschal hisses and chatters her teeth in disgust, but keeps her distance.

Name: Favour the Seneschal
Id: 129726
Description: Perhaps you've never liked rats; perhaps you've always been fond of rat-skin suits; perhaps the Seneschal's charms are too much for you. At any rate you're keen to find out more about their civilisation.

Name: A Knight Out of Habit
Id: 152196
Description: You bow to the Seneschal, who purrs with pleasure while the Chief Engineer gnashes his teeth, but keeps his distance.<br><br>

Name: Cold Shoulders
Id: 152202
Description: The Chief Engineer and the Seneschal share a look, then regard you with the same cool distance. <br><br>

"Coward," spits one. "Craven," sneers the other. 
<br><br>
They hold you in ferocious contempt. Well, good for them. You have a ship to sail. No doubt they'll change their tune if you come back. It's not like they're awash with allies.

		DefaultEvent
Name: Hubris
Id: 152203
Description: The Chief Engineer and the Seneschal share a look, then regard you with scornful amusement.<br><br>

"Yes," smirks the Chief Engineer, "You're obviously much cleverer than us."
<br><br>

"Oh, much," murmurs the Seneschal. "You clearly know us much better than we know ourselves." <br><br>
Apparently idealism won't help, here.
