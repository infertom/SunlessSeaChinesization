		DefaultEvent
Name: A carnivorous complexity
Id: 155747
Description: How many jaws does this monster have? Each folds into the next like an orchid of bone. They're wrecked by cannon-fire now, but you think you counted seven. It suggests unlikely things about the nature, or impossibility, of Neathly processes of evolution...

Name: Rescue a New Jonah

Description: The eel's gut twitches. Is something alive in there?

		DefaultEvent
Name: Slice it open!
Id: 172689
Description: A bandage-wrapped fellow clambers out of the slit. Well: they were bandages, before they were steeped for weeks in the internal juices of an eel. Now the effect is more like a kind of rollmop linguine. "Does wonders for my complexion," he remarks, squelchingly. "But I suppose it's time to go. Could you drop me off at Venderbight?"

Name: Dissect it
Id: 124691
Description: for knowledge.

		DefaultEvent
Name: A setback
Id: 144293
Description: But you are a little too careless: the slime that coats it is poisonous, and as it passes into your blood, you pass out. You recover consciousness with your ship's doctor anxiously chafing your wrists. The Moray has disintegrated in the zee-currents.

		SuccessEvent
Name: Nature's armoury
Id: 144294
Description: Observe its teeth: the hooks, the clamps, the cunning tendons of the jaw. Its skin, which almost defeats your knives, and which secretes a slime containing a toxin that causes paralysis of the nerves. You can learn from these...

		RareSuccessEvent
Name: Your attention drifts
Id: 148476
Description: ...as you hack up the beast. Somehow, you seem no longer to be engaged in dissection, but climbing a pale shingle beach. The pebbles glisten with slime. Beyond the ridge of the beach, you hear music: a careless cheery piping. You struggle higher. Zee-bats zip past. The piping ends abruptly: all is silence. You look back down the beach to the Unterzee: shafts of light pierce the darkness. "The Sun!" cries a voice. "The Sun!"
<br/><br/>
No: no Sun. You are kneeling in darkness, in the disintegrating innards of a giant eel.
