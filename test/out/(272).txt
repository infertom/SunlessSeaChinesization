Name: Almost a monster
Id: 141255
Description: The strangling horror that emerges from the water is - you learn later - four feet eight inches in length. Consequently it falls short of the five feet six inches which would qualify it as a monstrosity under Department of Menace Eradication guidelines. This is little comfort to the screaming seaman in whom it embeds its many mouths. You extinguish its horrid life with a flurry of gaff-hooks, but too late for him...
