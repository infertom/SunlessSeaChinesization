Name: The Alarming Scholar
Id: 141886
Description: The Alarming Scholar is mercurial, to say the least. A creature of sudden moods and provoking teeth. Possibly her (is it her?) appointment as University Maritime Liaison was precautionary: to keep his (is it his?) razor-sharp enthusiasm from causing too many injuries in the faculty.
<br/><br/>
"Ah yes," the Scholar whispers breathily. "I have a budget for acquisitions. What have you brought me?" [If you have any knowledge items that the Scholar will buy, they'll appear below.]

		DefaultEvent
Name: Wells of emotion
Id: 144824
Description: As the Alarming Scholar listens, tears well in the depths of those shining (or is it blazing?) eyes. They overflow, splashing on to the desk-blotter. "Stop!" he (she?) sobs, at last. "This is too - too beautiful. Allow me to bring the Macaw of Memories. I wish each individual tone recalled."

		DefaultEvent
Name: Deep excitement
Id: 144825
Description: The Scholar circles your specimen jar, tapping at the glass with a variety of tools: screw-driver, magnet, scrutinizer, tuning-fork, flensing knife, and a sort of slotted spoon. "This will keep them going for weeks," she (he?) says, half to himself. "We'll dine at the High Table tonight, I think."

		DefaultEvent
Name: A beaming smile
Id: 144826
Description: "This would be so terribly wasted in an ossuary!" She (he?) buffs the cranium with a sleeve. "I think a climbing briar-rose will suit this one rather well. A yellow rose, perhaps. Thank you so much. Let's keep this between ourselves."

Description: "You've been so very helpful. I wanted to give you something for your next voyage. I bottled it myself - "

		DefaultEvent
Name: Dark glass
Id: 144866
Description: It smells pickled, chemical. Zalty. Once, it might have been eel-flesh. But the Scholar assures you that it has vital and nutritional virtues. Save it for an emergency, perhaps.

		DefaultEvent

		DefaultEvent
Name: Glinting eyes
Id: 145887
Description: "Oh my." Teeth bared in a hungry grin: there's something odd about those teeth, as if there were too many of them. "This will make quite a dent in my acquisitions budget. But worth it, I think. Yes. Worth it."

		DefaultEvent
Name: Memories
Id: 154264
Description: Prisoned light scratches at the surface of the Core. "Oh, yes," the Alarming Scholar breathes. "Oh, yes." She (he?) seems to have forgotten you. "So many savours. Come here, my love, come here." The irrigo glow at its core brightens. Colour leaks from the room, to be replaced by one shade only.
<br/><br/>
You wake slowly in your cabin. The swinging lights seem dull after the irrigo glow. Your eyes itch oddly. What happened, exactly? The Scholar, you know, will never speak of it.

		DefaultEvent

<br/><br/>
Proctors burst in and drag the Scholar from his (her?) office. One shakes a sorrowful head at you. "Academics," he sighs. "They never last." You are left clutching a bundle of scrawled notes. You peep cautiously at the first page. Symbols boil before your eyes. The study seems suddenly, terribly bright. No! NO!
