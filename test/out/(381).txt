Id: 176515
Description: His Complexity is watching you. His eyes are cold as polished stones, but a smile lurks at the corner of his mouth, like an eel in ambush.

Name: Ask for assistance
Id: 143967
Description: "Your Complexity: there is a question only you can answer, to open the final gate of my journey, to my father's bones. I ask this boon of you."

		DefaultEvent
Name: Little favours
Id: 176516
Description: "You are fortunate," the Fathomking announces. "I have only a few small requests. Fulfil them, and I shall tell you what you need to know."
<br/><br/>
"Bring me the heart of a legend."
<br/><br/>
"Bring me a light from the sky."
<br/><br/>
"Bring me a willing guest, to stay with me forever."
<br/><br/>
"Witness the end of the eldest among its kind. Bring me word."
<br/><br/>
"Bring me the fruit of an eternal tree."
<br/><br/>
"And bring me something scientific. Modern. Cutting-edge, I believe, is the term. My Bride enjoys that sort of thing."
<br/><br/>
He sits back, under-regions pulsing with expectation. "You seem quite capable," he adds carelessly. "I'm sure it's not too much trouble."

		DefaultEvent
Name: "It is sufficient."
Id: 176700
Description: The Fathomking nods. "I always liked her. But I'm glad she's dead. She would have caused trouble, some day."
<br/><br/>
His Drownie chamberlain spirits the heart away on a platter, and gifts you a barbed iron charm for your ship's prow. "Is that all?" the King inquires pleasantly.

Id: 176706
Description: "Oh, a pity. She sent so many interesting people here below. But I am a Power of my word. She was a legend. Here. Place this on your ship's bow, and it will give you strength in battle." His chamberlain gifts you a barbed iron charm, and spirits the heart away on a platter.
<br/><br/>
The King purses his lips. "Hearts," he muses. "I should develop another one. I grow more elaborate by the day."

<br/><br/>
His Drownie chamberlain spirits the heart away on a platter, and gifts you a barbed iron charm for your ship's prow. At a nod from the king, he also hands you a set of carved ivory spheres within spheres. "By way of reward," the King explains, "for your sound choice of target."

Description: "Your Complexity. Here is the heart of a legend."

		DefaultEvent
Name: A deep sigh
Id: 176709
Description: The Fathomking is silent for an uncomfortably long time. Then he is silent for a while longer. After that, he sinks back in the pool and continues to say absolutely nothing at all. His chamberlain draws back. The guards stand motionless. You are eyeing the exits from the chamber when, finally, he speaks.
<br/><br/>
"Were you aware," he enquires, "that this is the heart of my niece? By marriage, not by blood; and I doubt you have truly ended her. She is robust. Nevertheless..."
<br/><br/>
He drums his fingers on the rim of his throne-bowl. "I am in part to blame, and besides, I am a Power of my word. What's done is done. But I must exact payment. Honour demands it."
<br/><br/>
His Drownie chamberlain spirits the egg away on a platter, and gifts you a barbed iron charm for your ship's prow. "You have fulfilled my request" - the King decrees - "thus your reward. But I must now pronounce this curse upon you. Stand still, please..."

Description: "Your Complexity. Here is a miracle of science and the subtler arts. Glass and fire, steel and serpents, power and prisoned dreams."

		DefaultEvent
Name: "Fascinating!"
Id: 176711
Description: "Is that a Fingerking in there? Alive? And it makes your ship <i>go</i>? I must say, that's splendidly done. You have fulfilled my request handsomely."
<br/><br/>
At his gesture, a Drownie child walks forward, bare feet slapping on rock, to present you with a knife of coral. (The chamberlain, meanwhile, kindly arranges to replace your engine with a spare from a ship they had 'recently eaten'.)

		DefaultEvent
Name: "Intriguing!"
Id: 176712
Description: "What a completely horrible object," the Fathomking observes. "Honestly, if you had flayed a star and brought me its skin, it couldn't be more appalling than this. But I recognise the achievement. You have fulfilled my request."
<br/><br/>
At his gesture, a Drownie child walks forward, bare feet slapping, to present you with a knife of coral. (The chamberlain, meanwhile, kindly arranges to replace your device with a weapon from a ship they had 'recently eaten'.)

Id: 144109
Description: The Survivor is free of its past, but what of its future? The King could open doors to it, here below.

		DefaultEvent
Name: "Be welcome."
Id: 176713
Description: The Survivor leaves your side without a word. So much for sentiment. It nods respectfully to the King, who extends a limb to touch its bulging forehead.
<br/><br/>
"You will be my cup-bearer," the King announces. "You will learn the shapeling arts from my Bride. I will reward the one who brought you here, with gifts of pearl and knowledge, and with the Word that compels attention. And one day, perhaps, more..."

		ChildBranches 9
Name: Introduce the Fathomking to your Chef-Paramount
Id: 144112
Description: The Chef has learnt everything there is to know of cuisine above the waves. Perhaps he's ready to learn of the culinary treasures below. You'd miss him, but you owe him the chance.

		DefaultEvent
Name: "Magnificent!"
Id: 176716
Description: The Chef's moustaches quiver with excitement. He kisses his hand to you and bounds creakily to the Fathomking's side. "I am at your Complexity's service! I have so many questions! The savours of the Peligin Wash: are they distinct? Can Mutersalt survive that fundamental pressure? Is the Feast truly Fluke-flesh?"
<br/><br/>
The King attempts several times to interrupt the Chef's excited babbling. When he fails, he gestures to his chamberlain. You are rewarded with a Word which compels attention, and an assurance that your service has been recognised.

Name: Bear witness to the Curator's End
Id: 144114
Description: The First Curator was eldest among its kind. This will certainly satisfy the Fathomking.

		DefaultEvent
Name: An ending
Id: 176718
Description: " - and then ceased to move. I had never seen a moth so big - and its wings! Figured with patterns in all the colours I had brought the Curator - "
<br/><br/>
The Fathomking listens. His face is expressionless, but his under-regions pulse with hammerish fury. "Very good," he says at last (a little breathlessly?). "You have fulfilled my request. Come closer. I will tell you something of the movement of moths: their mysteries and evasions..."

Id: 144115
Description: How old was the Principles? The Eldest? Perhaps old enough to satisfy the Fathomking.

		DefaultEvent
Name: An ending
Id: 176719
Description: "'Hurry,' it told me. 'My thoughts grow burdensome.'" And then, at the chess game's end, the dissolution.
<br/><br/>
The Fathomking listens. A single tear rolls down his cheek, though his face remains expressionless. His chamberlain steps forward, to remove the tear with a darting tongue.
<br/><br/>
"My Bride's family," he tells you. "They have long grown eccentric, and the Principles was the most eccentric of all. Yes, that is sufficient. Come closer, and I will tell you something of other dissolutions..."

		DefaultEvent
Name: A satisfactory gift
Id: 176720
Description: The Fathomking's chamberlain takes the Apple from you, and carries it to him on a salver of verdigrised bronze. The Fathomking accepts the gift, and abruptly drops it into the throne-pool. It is sucked into the churn of the King's under-regions.
<br/><br/>
"Very good," the King says, languidly. "I will have you sent certain leaves from my library..."

		DefaultEvent
Name: An emission from a far place
Id: 176721
Description: The Fathomking's chamberlain takes the Sporule from you, and carries it to him on a salver of verdigrised bronze. The Fathomking accepts the gift, and abruptly drops it into the throne-pool. It disappears into the churn of the King's under-regions. The King sits upright, blinking.
<br/><br/>
"My," he says. "The saucy old creature. Perhaps I should not share this story with my Bride. A very satisfactory service, Captain! I will have you sent certain leaves from my library. And you have fulfilled my request..."

Description: It's what he asked for.

		DefaultEvent
Name: With utmost care
Id: 176806
Description: The Fathomking's chamberlain pulls on a pair of squid-leather gloves and takes the Box from you. He does not approach the Fathomking: he takes it directly to a slit at the side of the room.
<br/><br/>
"Satisfactory," the Fathomking says swiftly. "As to your payment. There are optical techniques lost to the upper sea: but now you will learn them..."

Description: There is something celestial about that light. Will it suffice?

		DefaultEvent
Name: "Ahhhh..."
Id: 176807
Description: The Fathomking requests a pair of squid-leather gloves from his chamberlain before he accepts the gem. He turns it over and over in his gloved hands. The light stitches shadows across the hollows of his face.
<br/><br/>
"The God called Stone," he says. "My sister by marriage. Of all of us, she is the best. Thank you. This isn't what I would have chosen, but it's a pleasant surprise, and the request is fulfilled. I will share certain secrets of optics with you. And - chamberlain! Give this generous captain enough pearls to fill their cupped hands."

		DefaultEvent
Name: "Sss..."
Id: 176808
Description: The King reaches for it, seems to catch himself, draws back. All around the room, the thorned guards rustle. 
<br/><br/>
"Interesting," he says thickly. "Yes. Yes, that will suffice. Chamberlain. Put it in the Deep. Give our brave Captain here the notes on the alternate optics..."

		DefaultEvent
Name: The reek of the drowned
Id: 177270
Description: The Fathomking stinks of salt and rotting flesh, but also of something electric, ozone, alien. His breath is cold. He whispers in your ear, and he presses something into the palm of your hand.
<br/><br/>
"Go now. Good luck." He smiles thinly. "Perhaps one day your child will stand before me and ask the same questions."

		DefaultEvent
Name: "Yes."
Id: 178717
Description: He crooks a finger, and a Drownie-child brings forward a pale bone on a mouldering cushion. "Most mortals come to this, some day," the King remarks. "I will not, of course. Perhaps you will not... but you'll learn more of that from the Bone Men." He flicks his finger again, and the child retreats.<br/><br/>

Id: 178718
Description: "I will give you the address you need, for the small consideration we discussed. But I won't share personal information so easily. I have my business with the Masters of the Bazaar. It's not always a pleasant business." He shrugs. There are ripples. "One has one's duties."<br/><br/>

Id: 178719
Description: "''The heart is destiny's engine', they used to say in Irem. Your father knew that. He wanted to free himself of his destiny." The King yawns. "He paid me for my help. He failed, and so you are here. Perhaps one day your son, your daughter, will stand before me and ask where your bones lie. Or perhaps they'll ask me for a knife."<br/><br/>

He chuckles. "Sorry. An old bad habit. I enjoy being mysterious as much as the next half-human Power, but honestly, I have no idea what broke it. I do know where the shard lies, though. Pay my price, and I'll tell you."<br/><br/>
