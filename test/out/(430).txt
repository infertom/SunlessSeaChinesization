Name: Sovereign Island
Id: 175471
Description: Today, the sprawling palace is called the Wildweald Court. Tomorrow, who knows? The world of the Pentecost apes is one of cruel whimsy, where stolen traditions last only as long as their amusement.

		ChildBranches 1
Name: Gain access to the Court
Id: 143282
Description: The gates are guarded by two armoured monkeys that would look adorable if not for the blood on their bayonets. Humans are not welcome without an invitation or a worthy gift for the Emperor.

Name: The Wildweald Court
Id: 175472
Description: The stench and heat as the gates open are a sucker-punch to your senses. Inside, the stagnant air of the windowless wood palace hangs with sweat and tastes of hair.
<br /><br />
Everything is filthy, and every surface used; the apes as likely to swing across the roof as walk the floors. In prized oases of relative calm, the high-souled conduct themselves with the poise of highborn lords and ladies. Around them, their barely uplifted lessers scamper around exhausted, taking orders and cruelties from all who care to dispense them. In the middle are countless more; a sea of apes longing for advancement and fighting for what they have with tooth, claw and low cunning.

		DefaultEvent
Name: She sees you over the crowd
Id: 179007
Description: "Ah!" she shouts. <i>"Kapitano!"</i> She strides through the crowd, her hair and clothes encrusted with dry bits of egg and tomato and things better not even recognised. "Kapitano, I wanted you to know, I bear you no grudges! Have you ever been to a place called, oh, Saviour's Rocks? The monkeys tell me it is most interesting!"
