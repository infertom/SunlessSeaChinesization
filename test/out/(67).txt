Description: SIGIL-RIDDEN NAVIGATOR: Is it true you people live forever?
ADVENTURESS: That's not a good question to ask.<br/>
SIGIL-RIDDEN NAVIGATOR: I'm sorry.
<br/>
ADVENTURESS: Oh, what the hell. No, we don't live for ever. But we can live a thousand years. <i>Some</i> of us can live a thousand years.<br/>
SIGIL-RIDDEN NAVIGATOR: Then I'm even sorrier.
<br/>
ADVENTURESS:Great Stone, man, you're depressing! Can you cheer up a little? Please?<br/>
