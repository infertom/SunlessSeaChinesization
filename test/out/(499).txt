To this you add your own impressions about the street layout close to port and the types of commerce here. When the lights are especially bright, it is possible to make out the details of the profile of that great stone face.

Name: Put a blemmigan ashore
Id: 147303
Description: The blemmigan wraps its tendrils around your fingers, buries its fleshy dome in your palm. What does it want?

		DefaultEvent
Name: An apt shelter
Id: 181988
Description: The blemmigan is oddly shy; it sidles onto the quay with obvious reluctance. It puts on a burst of speed to hide under a damaged, discarded mask - resting in a refuse heap with fish heads and broken tackle. The bulging-eyed shell gives it confidence - if not grace: it departs at speed, bouncing into a buoy waiting for repairs, recoiling off an unused engine.
