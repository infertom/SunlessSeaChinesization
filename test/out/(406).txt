Name: The House of the Question
Id: 151296
Description: North-west of Whither town, the House of the Question stands alone. Here the initiates of the House make offerings to the three gods of the deep zee, and perhaps a fourth who is not a god. It's the one place in Whither where you can sometimes get a straight answer... for a price.

[Gaining the Attention of a god is useful chiefly for lifting curses.]

Description: Storm's shrine is red with blood and wine. Feed it.

		DefaultEvent
Name: A bloody rite
Id: 151297
Description: The initiates of the House perform the sacrifice. It seems a great deal messier than it needs to be. One catches your quizzical gaze. "Storm's a messy eater," she confides. "You should know what you're getting into. But he's heard your name now."

Name: Gain Stone's Attention
Id: 129166

		DefaultEvent
Name: Sweet scents and song
Id: 151298
Description: The initiates fling handfuls of scented salts into the flames and chant in the language of the Elder Continent. You hear your name wound into the chant. At last, the preceptress nods to you. "She has your face."

Name: Gain Salt's Attention
Id: 129167
Description: The walls around Salt's shrine are written over with tales. Bring it a story.

		DefaultEvent
Name: No echo
Id: 151299
Description: Your words sink into the silence like stones into quicksand. The initiate listens, eyes closed, committing every detail to memory. "Leave now. If you see where I write your story, it's the worst kind of luck."

Name: Ask about the Drowned Man
Id: 129168
Description: The initiates of the House are reluctant to speak of him, but you may be able to bribe them enough to gain a few tenuous snippets.

		DefaultEvent
Name: The end and the beginning
Id: 151300
Description: "He is not a god. He came from the North, where it is too cold for gods, and to the North he will return. If you go North, nothing of you will remain."

Name: The law and the loss
Id: 151304
Description: "The Drowned Man's brothers - aye, and sisters - gave him to the knives and the lacre. Here we have no lacre, only snow. Snow comes from the North. Lacre comes from pain. We have it a little easier."

Name: Lift Storm's Curse
Id: 129169
Description: "This is going to be pretty grim," an initiate warns you. "And if you close your eyes, we'll have to start from the beginning. Storm takes cursing seriously."

		DefaultEvent
Name: It's not pretty
Id: 151301
Description: The initiates give themselves to the frenzy. The sacrifice that you brought takes hours to die. Your clothes are steeped seven times in blood. The curse is gone, they tell you: but it'll be a long time before the smell is.

Name: Lift Stone's Curse
Id: 129170
Description: Stone is not a vengeful god, but her memory is long. She will require rich offerings. The initiates want paying, too. "You've brought the parts," one tells you, "but you need to cover the labour too."

		DefaultEvent
Name: A roaring flame
Id: 151302
Description: The initiates build a pyre of riches: all that linen up in smoke, length by length, all that scintillack cracked and sizzling. You'd heard that scintillack screamed when burnt, and now you know it's true. "I think she's forgiven you," the preceptress whispers at last. "Don't do it again."

Name: Lift Salt's Curse
Id: 129171
Description: No one will answer you when you speak of Salt's Curse. It takes you half a day to glean what it might demand of you. But at least if they can't speak of it, they can't quote you a price.

		DefaultEvent
Name: An awakening
Id: 151303
Description: You were due to go to the House today, weren't you? But it's the third watch already. No - you had gone. There were the words - the bells - and then - you can remember almost nothing. "All shall be well," someone told you, "and all manner of thing shall be well." Clutched in your hand is a single white petal, as fresh as if plucked just now on the Surface. It's the token of the curse's ending.

Name: Defy the Gods
Id: 129819
Description: Spit on the floor. Curse the priests. Overturn an altar. [This will increase your Iron and Hearts by 5 each, up to 110, and set your Terror to 0: but you will never be able to remove any god's curse, or benefit in certain other ways.]

		DefaultEvent
Name: It's done!
Id: 152322
Description: Your crew are cheered by your courageous impiety. They have their superstitions, but a captain who blackens the eye of the gods themselves is a captain of verve and vigour. Later, though, when the night draws in, they whisper and make the signs against evil...
