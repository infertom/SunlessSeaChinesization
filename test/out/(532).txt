Name: A Lonely Desert Beach
Id: 146633
Description: There is no habitation in sight, no market, very little in the way of a maintained dock. A stretch of sand thickens into damp, black earth, from which sprout stunted... Palms? Not quite: tall fungal growths with frond-like caps, as if someone sculpted the idea of a tree from a mushroom. 
<br>
<br>
These growths appear sparse near the beach, but clump closer together the farther inland one goes, clustering tightly into a sort of forest around the base of the island's central hill.
<br>
<br>
You can see, off in the distance, dots of fire flecking the horizon, and hear clamour, shouts, and shot; if you look to the quay, you can make out the unusual shapes of two tiny figures.

Description: As you step on to the quay, you hear clamour, shouts, and shot; you can see, off in the distance, smoke rising from beyond the hill, and dots of fire flecking the horizon. 

<br><br>Two tiny figures stand a little further down the quay, unmoving, rather as if awaiting your approach.
