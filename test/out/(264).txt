Name: An Interview with the Avuncular Broker
Id: 181260
Description: He meets you on the balcony of a shoreside coffee-house. His handshake is effusive. His smile and cummerbund are broad. He urges you to squares of sticky baklava, and a tiny glass of black coffee sweetened with a sprig of mint.

"I trust you won't mind answering a few questions?" He asks, opening a notebook. "To ensure we're on the same page, so to speak." The interview is scandalously personal. What business has he to ask such things?
