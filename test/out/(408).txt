Name: The Chelonate
Id: 143328
Description: Waves lap the slabby sides of a vast turtle-shell - bigger than any cathedral. Chelonites loaf on wooden docks around the shell-sides, staring sullenly. Lamps hang like decorations in a festive butcher's window. All around you, the sea is rank with scraps of ancient flesh.

Name: Deliver Sphinxstone for Penstock
Id: 143696
Description: The Bone Man awaits you. His face and chest are streaked with white clay. His forehead bears a glyph, in the deep code of the void. Long ago, his mother ritually severed his littlest finger. "STONES HERE," he rumbles.

		DefaultEvent
Name: The Death of Stones
Id: 176113
Description: The Bone Man carries a maul. No: he <i>bears</i> a maul. "WATCH," he growls. He brings the head of the maul down on the largest stone. It puffs into dust: instantly pulverised. "YOU MUST STRIKE THEM IN ONLY THE CORRECT PLACE." Another dissolves, with a sound like a sigh. "THUS."
<br/><br/>
Perhaps it's just that you've inhaled too much dust, but as you watch the Bone Man, the scene becomes distant. You are watching it from a great height. The roof?
<br/><br/>
The maul swings: the stones shatter. This is the nature of strength. This is good.
<br/><br/>
"THIS IS THE WORK OF STORM," intones the Bone Man. You blink. "FREEDOM IS HIS GIFT TO THE BAZAAR. AND THIS IS MY GIFT TO YOU." He hands you a bag of coins, white with dust. You, too, are white all over with dust - white as bone.

		DefaultEvent
Name: A pocketful of Echoes
Id: 180640
Description: The Surgeon is as good as his word. Hands trembling, he counts out the coins, and whispers a little secret he picked up back in London. He's vague about why he didn't mention it before.
<br/><br/>
He collects his knives and instruments, heads into the Shell, and is gone.

Name: Meet your contact

Description: A Mutilated Hunter makes her home in a plastron at the wretched end of the shell: well, the <i>more</i> wretched end. Her face is half-immobile from a jillyfish sting. Give her a Hunting Trophy, and she'll share zee-gossip.

Name: Find someone to teach secrets of butchery to the Bandaged Poissonnier
Id: 147264
Description: A Bone Man shows you the glyphs cut into his white-dusted palms. "They mean 'Separation'," he tells you. He will instruct your chef, if you can prove your worth.

		DefaultEvent
Name: An improvement
Id: 181939
Description: When the Poissonnier returns to the ship, he is red to his elbows. "I have learned what I need to know," he says, his voice haggard. Back in the galley he throws away all his knives but one. You watch it slice, skin, bone, and butterfly: as precise as a surgeon's scalpel; as quick as a minnow. Flesh goes one way; skin and organs another.
<br/><br/>
As the crew dine, he seeks you out. "It goes well, my captain. I have my initial ingredients. I have my skills. But the flavours I pursue must be coaxed forth, like a hermit crab from its shell. I'm afraid I need very particular seasoning: mutersalt and zzoup. They sell the former at Whither, where the salt-pools fizz and pop. Zzoup is made at Mount Palmerston. Its composition is a secret, but anything that can be combined can be separated again, with the right equipment."

Name: The limits of meaningful expression
Id: 182472
Description: No matter what details you try to record, the stench creeps in around the edges of the sentences. "The Chelonites, watchful despite the reek." "Movement among the miasmic scraps of long-abandoned monster-carcass." "Frequent duels where the stink is thickest - "

Id: 146190
Description: "I couldn't understand why she came here to begin with, but" - she gestures around you, at the designs sketched on hide and scratched on stone. "It's all tattoos. The alphabets of bone and flesh. That's what our family keeps coming back to." She frowns. "Our family is strange in every way imaginable."

<br/><br/>
The Daughter assembles the rags of her composure with remarkable speed. "Excuse us," she says...
