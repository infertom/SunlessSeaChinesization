Name: The Secret of the Nocturne
Id: 167523
Description: Under the webs and years of grinding salt, the Nocturne remains untouched. But what do the sorrow-spiders want from its carcass?

		ChildBranches 1
Name: Search the regular cabins
Id: 138558
Description: Perhaps it was not the Nocturne itself, but a passenger that drew the sorrow-spiders' interest?

		DefaultEvent
Name: If so, it is not clear why
Id: 167608
Description: Unless they long for musical instruments, half-finished poetry, or a clock that is not even right once a day, there is little here they might want.

		RareDefaultEvent
Name: If so, it is not clear why
Id: 167613
Description: Unless they long for a collection of most pornographic wood-carvings, a forbidden novel of love in the Second City, or the pickled body of a zee-bat, there is little here that they might want.

Id: 138560
Description: Every corner, every inch... the Nocturne's secret will be found.

		DefaultEvent
Name: Paraphernalia, rot, nothing!

Name: A Young Scholar's Notebook
Id: 138561
Description: Aha! In theory at least, a most illuminating tome!

		DefaultEvent
Name: Being a Detailed Study of the Lost Creatures of the Deeper Uncharted Unterzee by K. L. Stalveis 
Id: 167612
Description: It is an unfinished treatise, the few completed sections a masterwork in turning forbidden knowledge into tiresome ephemera. The pictures however show great underwater beasts unlike any you have ever before heard witnessed. A theme of tentacles and madness persists throughout, until in the end even the once-copperplate handwriting is simply a scrawl. 
<br /><br />
Surely, this must be it. If not, whatever the sorrow-spiders seek is too well hidden or has long since been taken by one unfearing of Salt's wrath.

Name: Take nothing. Touch nothing.
Id: 138912
Description: To rob a half-drowned ship of valuables is against the code of the zee... even if nobody is watching.

		DefaultEvent

Id: 168231

Name: Explore the lower levels
Id: 138913
Description: You are alone here... right?

		DefaultEvent
Name: Empty corridors, untouched rooms
Id: 168232
Description: The sorrow-spiders took little from the Nocturne save its crew. Their attack froze it in time, from the broken glass of a long-dried out brandy decanter to the still damp charcoal in the extinguished engines.

		ParentEvent

Description: 

		RareDefaultEvent
Name: A movement in the dark!
Id: 168233
Description: What was that? A ghost? No. Just the flickering of a candle. At least the crew did not see it. simply being here has them superstitious enough.



		ChildBranches 6
Name: Search the stateroom
Id: 138914
Description: As close to luxury as one can expect on the zee. Whoever stayed here was blessed indeed.

		DefaultEvent
Name: Soft pillows. Warm sheets.
Id: 168234
Description: An acquired taste for those who value comfort. No secrets however, at least none on open display.

		ParentEvent

		RareDefaultEvent
Name: The Diary of a Perfidious Composer
Id: 168235
Description: A scandalous document to be sure! It does not however contain anything the sorrow-spiders are likely to consider relevant to their interests.



		ChildBranches 7
Name: Check in with the rest of the crew
Id: 138915
Description: They are being quiet. Entirely too quiet.

		DefaultEvent
Name: Nothing but darkness
Id: 168236
Description: Everyone had best hurry. These candles will not last forever. Nor will the solitude.

		ChildBranches 8
Name: A moment's fear
Id: 138909
Description: A sliver of ice down the spine. A hot sweat. The sense of something watching, from within or without.

		DefaultEvent
Name: Ghosts of the Nocturne
Id: 168221
Description: It is said that the Nocturne was sunk by the Tree of Ages, the fist of the sorrow-spiders. If any ship was going to have ghosts, it would be this one. What else could it be?

		ParentEvent

Name: Ghosts of the Nocturne?
Id: 168226
Description: It is said that the Nocturne was sunk by the Tree of Ages, the fist of the sorrow-spiders. If any ship was going to have ghosts, it would be this one. But no. This feels older than mere death, and somehow... further away. At least, further away for now.



		ChildBranches 9
Name: A sudden cold shiver
Id: 138713
Description: Is there someone behind you? No, further than that. Much further. But getting closer.

		DefaultEvent
Name: An unseeing eye is watching
Id: 167906
Description: There are probably no ghosts on the Nocturne. That does not preclude there being some kind of curse.

		ParentEvent

		ChildBranches 10
Name: Send a pair of scouts in first
Id: 138911
Description: It is unlikely that anything is lurking, but...

		DefaultEvent
Name: A long, long wait
Id: 168223
Description: A flare goes up from the Nocturne. It's safe. The wait has not however been good for crew morale.

		ParentEvent

Description: 

		RareDefaultEvent
Name: A missing crewman
Id: 168229
Description: A flare goes up from the Nocturne. It's safe. But inside, only one scout remains. The other thought to help herself to a little treasure. Her partner was more Salt-fearing. That at least explains the quiet splash sound a while earlier. A pity, but not one crewman would have advocated anything else.

		SuccessEvent
Name: A long, long wait
Id: 168228
Description: A flare goes up from the Nocturne. It's safe.



		ChildBranches 11
Name: Lead the boarding party
Id: 138910
Description: Gaining entrance will mean hacking through a forest of old spider-webs. You will show the crew there is nothing to fear.

		DefaultEvent
Name: A forest of nightmares
Id: 168222
Description: The dry webbing winds round your limbs and gets in your mouth as you hack through it. Why do the sorrow-spiders feel so compelled to leave their mark like this? What do they hope to catch out here?

		ParentEvent

Name: Search the Captain's cabin
Id: 138557
Description: Who could better know the ship's secrets?

		DefaultEvent
Name: A ship of memories, not clues
Id: 167606
Description: Along with the scattered bottles of mushroom wine, his logs tell the tale of a ship with an interesting history. There is nothing about anything it may have discovered this far from home however. At least, not in any form a fellow zailor might observe.

		ParentEvent

		RareDefaultEvent
Name: The true story of the Perfidious Composer
Id: 167607
Description: Along with the scattered bottles of mushroom wine, his logs tell the tale of a ship with an interesting history. This was a scandal that crossed the zee back to Fallen London, many years ago. There remains enough interest for it to be worth a few Echoes.

		SuccessEvent
Name: An escape from the Surface
Id: 168237
Description: Along with the scattered bottles of mushroom wine, his logs tell the tale of a ship with an interesting history. This one speaks of an earlier Captain's bravery, venturing to the Surface to ferry back lost souls who thought the sun still considered them friends. It is a pity that he returned entirely alone.



		ChildBranches 13
Name: Search the cargo hold
Id: 138499
Description: You don't know what you're looking for, you don't know if you'll know it when you see it, you don't know why it's important... but at least you know it's here. Isn't it?

		DefaultEvent
Name: The Nocturne had many passengers...
Id: 167524
Description: A true zailor takes on as few passengers as possible, unless they're nailed up in the hold like the better-behaved tomb-colonists. The Nocturne had musicians and poets and scholars on board when it met its fate. Their baggage contains little of interest though; or at least, nothing particularly relevant.

		ParentEvent

		RareDefaultEvent
Name: A sudden sharp shower
Id: 167605
Description: You can only be glad no one is here to see it as a crate of seven year old zeewater bursts open at your touch, soaking you to the skin.

		SuccessEvent
Name: The Nocturne had many passengers
Id: 168240
Description: Their belongings tell many stories. None of them however seem to be one the sorrow-spiders would take a direct interest in.

		RareSuccessEvent
Name: A secret, to be sure
Id: 168241
Description: One that speaks of at least one unfortunate encounter in the Nocturne's history. Not, however, one a sorrow-spider would likely find notable.



		ChildBranches 14
Name: A little bonus
Id: 138563
Description: The Nocturne's passengers left no shortage of delightful artefacts behind when they were taken. The crew would not approve. But the crew is not watching right now.

		DefaultEvent
Name: A sudden taste of blood and salt
Id: 167617
Description: What was that? It was probably nothing. These extra coins will do far more good in your pocket than at the bottom of the zee.

		ParentEvent

Description: 

		RareDefaultEvent
Name: A few coins nobody will miss or notice
Id: 167618
Description: These coins will do far more good in your pocket than at the bottom of the zee. It would be better not to take anything larger though. The crew would be... distracted.
