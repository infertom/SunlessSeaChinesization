Description: Has he ever found what he was looking for? No, he admits, but he has found so much more! Besides, they call it 'lost' treasure for a reason. No sense looking for it where it's meant to be!

Name: Persuade him to give you his map
Id: 143622
Description: It could be a profitable kindness.

		DefaultEvent
Name: A secret revealed
Id: 175999
Description: You bury the 'treasure', and with a few careful coughs and prods push the Lost Treasure Hunter towards it. He falls to the ground, digging furiously until he unearths his prize: bright, shining - his gaze pulled into its revelatory core.
<br /><br />
But soon, his excitement fades. Having found what he thought he wanted, his obsession is over and the reward merely a bauble; as diminished by being dragged from desire to reality as the face of an angel in mere paint.
<br /><br />
Sadder still is that once you persuade him to give you the map, it takes but a moment to realise his mistake. It's of Fountainhead! The fool had it upside down!
