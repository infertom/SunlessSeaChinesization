Name: Port Carnelian
Id: 175505
Description: London's first Unterzee colony sweats under a blanket of southern heat. To the right of the dock, the sapphire-mines yawn. To the left, the Governor's house stands, prim as an Elderwick mansion. Behind lies the fungal jungle, ghostly in white and violet.

		DefaultEvent
Name: Home away from home
Id: 175524
Description: They import the doilies from London, but the tea is local: blue and smoky. The crumpets are warm; the tablecloths white. You could almost imagine you were back in Veilgarden, except for the tiger lounging on a divan. It laps tea from an azure bowl and complains about the recent nostalgic trend in poetry.

Name: Talk to a tiger in the Blue Bazaar
Id: 143323
Description: The Carnelian Coast's padding natives are eloquent, placid, and acerbic. Most of the time.

		DefaultEvent
Name: Trouble abroad
Id: 175533
Description: The Blue Bazaar is Port Carnelian's great indoor market: arched, lofty, plush with patterned carpets where the vendors display their wares. Most of all, awash with gossip.
<br/><br/>
The tiger is well-informed. A black-hulled Khanate trireme prowled the coast last night, a rifle-shot from shore. Shipments from the sapphire mines have slowed. The Governor's aide was left-handed on Tuesday, and right-handed on Wednesday.

Description: The Blue Bazaar is Port Carnelian's great indoor market: arched, lofty, plush with patterned carpets where the vendors display their wares. Most of all, awash with gossip.
<br/><br/>
The tiger chats about the Banded Prince, their supposed monarch, and his palace deep in the jungle. You lever the conversation onto the state of his people. He has no complaints, he says. Not even about the recent re-instatement of the travel restriction on natives? Nor the report of a tiger killed at the jungle's edge? His tail flicks.

Id: 143370
Description: The diplomats of the Khanate were expelled from Port Carnelian following the Galatea Incident. Only one remains behind. "Not in any official capacity, you understand."

		DefaultEvent
Name: Off the record
Id: 175598
Description: "No, I'm retired, now," he tells you, cheerfully. His crockery is white as the moon, and rimmed with gold. Over tea, he comments sympathetically on the Governor's difficulties ("I feel for the man, I really do"), and asks probing questions regarding your travels. You manage to squeeze in a few of your own. "Oh, the Khan is very fond of sapphires. Blue is his favourite colour."

Id: 180523
Description: Since the colony's change of fortunes, the Governor has swapped his unassuming bowler hat for a towering stove-pipe. He laughs often. His watch-chain is gold, not silver.
<br/><br/>
He gives a full account of recent events. A tap of his nose, or a wriggle of his eyebrows, alerts you to those matters he cannot discuss more explicitly.

Description: The Banded Prince receives you in the airy, carpeted office that was once the Governor's. You recall the leaner, simpler days of the Restitution Committee. A footman fetches tea, his uniform splendidly striped. 
<br/><br/>
The Prince is happy to share news of his realm. You ask about the rival Empires across the zee: the Queen's and the Khan's. Will they try to reconquer the Coast? "They can try," he rumbles. His teeth are still sharp.

The Daughter assembles the rags of her composure with remarkable speed. "Excuse us," she says...

		RareSuccessEvent
Name: The tales are true!
Id: 180528
Description: Hacking through a fence of looming, lurid toadstools, you find a river. You gather up a cupped handful water, part your fingers, and watch it drain away. 
<br/><br/>
Your palms sparkle with blue stones. Your crew leap, laughing, into the river, scooping up handfuls of jewels. Enough to fill all your pockets. Enough to fill a barrel!
