Name: Your Father: Bones?
Id: 177526
Description: Decades ago, your father took refuge from his debtors, in Visage and in the bottle. "Of course I don't much like it," he explains. "But you know how expensive it can get, zee-captaining. The price of fuel alone! The Widow financed my last voyage, and the Widow never forgets. Wait. You haven't spoken to the Widow, have you?"
<br/><br/>
"Well, bugger."

Description: You bid him a clandestine farewell behind the midden, and he hands you a bundle of bones in burlap. There is an awkward silence. "I hear stories. I hear you're a natural philosopher," he says brightly. "That's... natural."
<br/><br/>
You look back once from the rail of your ship, as your crew gathers to congratulate you, sombrely, on your find. An old man in a rose-coloured lion-mask is watching you from the harbour. The crowd folds round him, and he's gone.
<br/><br/>
Whatever happens next - whatever you think of him - you finished what you set out to do, and that's changed you.

[Returning to London will end the game in a win, if you have enough money. Be sure you have at least six thousand Echoes on hand when you enter harbour, or your quest will fail.]

		DefaultEvent
Name: A blaze of bibulous delight
Id: 177528
Description: Your father is overjoyed to be returning to London; overjoyed to be leaving his decades-old role as a wrangler of foreign corpses. You can't help noticing the spark of calculation that ignites in his eye when he realises that his child can spare six thousand Echoes.
<br/><br/>
"I'll just stay out of the way," he says, cheery and a little slurred. "Let me know if I can help."
