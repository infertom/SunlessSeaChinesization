Name: Zailing the Empire of Hands
Id: 175461
Description: Communal wooden boats offer free passage to all travellers willing to row between islands.

		ChildBranches 1
Name: A Scouting Trip: Sovereign Island
Id: 143275
Description: A wooden palace stretches across the whole island, passage to it lit by a field of tiny glim buoys.

		DefaultEvent
Name: The heart of the Empire
Id: 175462
Description: Many boats circle the island, all keeping their distance. The one that gets closest is an extended rowboat painted in yellows, whites and reds. Four servant monkeys strain at the oars, while its true passenger sits in comfort behind a gauze curtain. Just for a moment an eye catches yours, but only for a moment. It would not do for a high-souled ape to see something so beneath its notice.

Name: A Scouting Trip: The Ash Isthmus
Id: 143276
Description: Neither man nor ape claims this volcanic remnant between islands. Haunted, they say. Ridiculous.

		DefaultEvent
Name: Of apes and monkeys
Id: 175463
Description: The trip offers a little time to think on the Penties. Technically, they are monkeys rather than apes, but it is not tactful to remind them of this. To their high-souled faces, the accepted name is 'Pentecost apes'. In private though, 'the b___y monkeys' is about as common. It is, one might say, an <i>ad hominoid</i> insult.

Name: A Scouting Trip: Fountainhead Island
Id: 143277
Description: Ancient secrets peek out of the trees. Any may visit, but few Penties ever bother to make the pilgrimage.

		DefaultEvent
Name: A young ancient empire
Id: 175464
Description: The Empire of Hands is hardly as old as they pretend, but mimicry and theft infuses their whole culture. If the Penties have come to think that rulers should be buried in ancient temples, then it is ancient temples they will build. It would hardly be the first time their attempts to mirror humanity have entirely missed the point.

Name: A Scouting Trip: Hearthsake Island
Id: 143278
Description: A thin pillar of greasy yet appetising smoke rises from the only human settlement in the Empire.

		DefaultEvent
Name: The Blumenbach Quarantine
Id: 175465
Description: The Admiralty has never stated precisely why it seeks to keep the Empire confined, though most opposition to it fades once said opposers actually encounter a Pentecost ape. They have been easy to corral, however. Though they do not lack wit, there is not an inventive bone in their hairy bodies, and no amount of stolen humanity has taught them the art of creating engines.

		DefaultEvent
Name: A quiet, yet exhausting, affair
Id: 176056
Description: It has been a long while since you spent this much time behind oars. Your muscles will be glowing by the time you finish your business in the Empire.

Name: A hunting party powers through the water
Id: 178339
Description: You barely row out of the way in time, for it has no intention of turning or slowing. The chattering of angry monkeys fades into the darkness as they head for the other islands in search of food.

Name: Travel to Hearthsake Village
Id: 143663
Description: The cannibals always have a seat at their table, and the Lost Treasure Hunter has much to trade.

		DefaultEvent
Name: A journey into temptation
Id: 176058
Description: The delicious smell of the cannibals' cooking stretches much of the way across the passing. It would make a vegetarian salivate and reach for a fork.

Name: A cold expanse of water
Id: 178335
Description: It is strange, after so long in a real ship, to be so close to the surface of the zee that you could run your hand through it. Not that this would be a good idea.

		DefaultEvent
Name: A softly spreading wake stretches out behind
Id: 176059
Description: The silence is peaceful here. No engine rumbling, no sounds of crew at work. Just your own heavy breathing as you row, and the rhythmic splash of waters.

Id: 178337
Description: These rowboats are not well maintained, if maintained at all. Water dribbles in from a small leak throughout, until it feels that there is as much zee within as without.
